		<text>I'm sorry, I don't have time to chat right now.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dm_action_info_1">
		<text>I’d rather wait until those handsome men in uniform go on their lunch break. No point hanging around here - I've got to get back to the Big Land, but they won’t let me through! I’m not the only one trying to get out, but none of us have managed to slip past yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_10">
		<text>There’s something nearby that the brass in shoulder straps are after. No one’s ever come this way before - everything was stripped clean, the cables cut long ago. And now, somehow, they’ve found it. I couldn’t even get close to the building. They spotted me and opened fire. Lucky for me it didn’t punch a hole right through.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_100">
		<text>I didn’t hear a thing - same story as always.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_11">
		<text>We’re putting together a team of people who don’t wet themselves at the thought of heading underground in the Zone. There’s an old factory with a maze of tunnels beneath it - word is, there’s all kinds of gear down there. Always something worth grabbing. Could be interesting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_12">
		<text>Not new - old! They say this used to be Gunslinger’s main base. Makes you wonder... if we look hard enough, maybe we’ll find something he left behind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_13">
		<text>I nearly got myself into trouble an hour ago. Six months back, this place was quiet - nothing but peace. Now it’s crawling with bandits in track pants hiding behind every bush. Unreal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_14">
		<text>You're lucky, stalker - the bandits didn’t drag you in. Their base is just next door. If it were up to me, I’d take the place out myself. For now, though, we’re just keeping an eye on it. This is just an outpost - their main base is deeper in, closer to the center of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_15">
		<text>They say there used to be a serious classified lab here. Uh-huh. Part of me wants to find the entrance - bet there’s a ton of valuable loot inside. But on the other hand… the place gives me the creeps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_16">
		<text>Did you know that before the disaster, there was an underground research complex in what's now the Dark Valley? I don't know exactly what they were doing down there, but I doubt it was anything good. There are all kinds of stories about the place - most of them bad. Some downright terrifying.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_17">
		<text>Why? What do you want to hear? Fine, I’ll tell you something! Duty - sure, they act like the Zone’s police, and yeah, they know how to keep things under control, sure. But I don’t like them one bit. Always acting like they own everything - don’t take this, don’t touch that, don’t carry that out of the Zone... And now they’ve even decided what people can and can’t talk about back on the Big Land! They say they want to destroy the Zone, piece by piece. Well, that’s soldiers for you - dreamers, the lot of them, even if they used to wear real uniforms. And the worst part? Word is, they’ve got backing from the very top.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_18">
		<text>This territory is under Duty’s control now, and our rules are the only law that matters here. We guard the Zone’s borders and keep the hotheads in check. Every day, thrill-seekers and starry-eyed rookies roll in by the trainload, dreaming of adventure... and then they drop like flies before the sun even sets.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_19">
		<text>Have you ever been to our transshipment base? It’s not just ours - lots of people pass through. The best part is, it’s clean, safe from most of the Zone’s nastier surprises, and it’s where all the news flows in. You can always pick up something useful or just chat about life. Shame Baldy left with a group the day before yesterday - I missed him this time around.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_2">
		<text>Let’s head to the camp - you’ll hear all the latest rumors there. That’s where most rookies like you end up anyway, either to gain some experience or catch a breather. We’ve got soldiers nearby, so don’t worry too much - but don’t get careless either. They won’t hesitate to shoot if you make the wrong move. There’s a spot near the merchant, our local trader, where you can settle in and rest for a while.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_20">
		<text>This place is safe now, stalker - and we do our best to keep it that way. There's always a crowd around here. Some folks have settled in and never venture beyond the outskirts, while others are gearing up for their next raid. It's a shame Iroquois didn’t make it back - he had a knack for showing rookies like you the ropes, always talking about the “way of the truth.”</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_21">
		<text>Did you hear Duty's running a new recruitment drive? I considered it for a moment, but then thought - why the hell would I need that? Back on the front line every other day, strict discipline, constant orders... I’ve done my two tours already. That’s more than enough for me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_22">
		<text>In case you haven’t heard - here’s the word: we’ve opened up additional recruitment. If you’ve got at least some experience under your belt, come on over. You won’t regret it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_23">
		<text>I don’t know anything. Just keep moving.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_24">
		<text>Fuck off - I’m not supposed to talk to you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_25">
		<text>Sorry, I’d rather not waste time on this conversation.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="dm_action_info_26">
		<text>They say if you catch some kind of illness in the Zone, it can drive you mad… You lose your sense of self entirely - and eventually, you just die.</text>
	</string>




	<string id="dm_action_info_27">
		<text>Damn, you ever hear about the stuff out here? Rabies and worse. It’s bad - real bad. If you catch it, you’re as good as dead.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="dm_action_info_28">
		<text>When a blowout hits Lake Yantar, all the equipment there goes haywire. If things go south, find cover - any shelter will do.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="dm_action_info_29">
		<text>Ever been to the swamps? They say there was some kind of massacre out there. It's dangerous - rumor has it the rain’s acidic, and the air’s filled with strange fumes...</text>
	</string>



	<string id="dm_action_info_3">
		<text>Shit, I'd love to get into that factory... word is, there are some pretty interesting documents stashed away in there.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="dm_action_info_30">
		<text>I heard there are some scientists running research down in the valley. They even hired one of our own for security. Haven’t heard from them in a while, though.</text>
	</string>




	<string id="dm_action_info_31">
		<text>Get out of here before nightfall! It's still daylight now, but once the sun sets...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_32">
		<text>Stalker, move out! We're taking down the cordon. We only hold it during the day - come nightfall, we’re gone. It’s too dangerous around here after dark.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_33">
		<text>You see, come nightfall, you’ve got to take cover - and make sure it’s behind something solid. Around here, it feels like we’re under siege once the sun goes down.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_34">
		<text>Well, buddy, looks like you haven’t heard the news - come nightfall, you’d better be bedding down far away from here. Even a grenade launcher won’t always save you when it gets dark!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_35">
		<text>You know what? Let Duty, Freedom, and all the looters fight over who owns this scrap - doesn’t matter to me. Fuck it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_36">
		<text>We’re running things here now, stalker. There’s enough trouble out there already - now these outsiders are making our lives even harder...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_37">
		<text>Just a heads-up - this place isn’t safe even during the day. There’s some kind of conflict going on between the local gangs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_38">
		<text>You tell me - this is our turf, right? Makes it easier for us to contain whatever crap comes crawling out of the Zone’s center. Let the eggheads poke around if they want, but Duty and those looters? They need to clear out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_39">
		<text>Didn’t you hear? There’s a new route past the Duty patrols to the perimeter. From Yantar, cut through the thick brush to Agroprom - easy as that, and you're out with the loot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_4">
		<text>Nothing, alright? I don’t know a damn thing! I’m just scraping by, trying to earn my daily bread. I’m too scared to go deep into the Zone - screw that place! And back home, there’s no work, and my wife’s always on my case... I’ve got to survive somehow, don’t I? Out here in the Garbage, if you walk around long enough, you can scavenge enough artifacts to afford food and a drink. That’s all I need.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_40">
		<text>What are you doing here? Heading to Yantar, or trying to sneak some artifacts past the Bar?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_41">
		<text>I won’t deny it - your fellow stalkers occasionally bring us some very curious anomalous formations… artifacts, as you call them. Given the loose control over these parts, this area has turned into quite the smuggling route.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_42">
		<text>Come on, man - we’ve carved out a path so you don’t have to bump into Duty patrols on your way to the Big Land! Yeah, they’re still around, sure. But as long as they don’t catch wind of it, we can steer clear of them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_43">
		<text>I just got back from Yantar. Figured I’d sell some stuff to the scientists like usual - but they’ve holed up in their bunkers, won’t even come out during the day unless it’s to meet the next helicopter. So if you’re heading that way, keep your eyes open - you might end up missing your chance.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_44">
		<text>There’s ongoing research in the Yantar zone, but lately, too many people have turned up dead. That’s why we’re posted here - guarding the approaches.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_45">
		<text>I don’t know what to tell you. I was planning to head back to our complex - Yantar, you know the place. But now? They say if it was dangerous before, it’s completely impassable now. Maybe they’re exaggerating… but maybe not.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_46">
		<text>I’ve been to Yantar - science there is practically shut down. They’re scared, hiding, only surviving off what the helicopters bring in. Then again, there’s corpses everywhere. Spend a week living among the dead and fear stops meaning much. It’s a nice place. Just not a pretty one.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_47">
		<text>Fuck those dogs, always lurking with the dead! There’s more of them every day in this godforsaken complex - and they’re getting bigger, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_48">
		<text>We're doing our best to keep the dead from spreading beyond the lab complex. Honestly, we could use an extra hand - if you're up for it. We're running low on manpower.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_49">
		<text>You know, we’ve been conducting our own reconnaissance. I’ve been mapping the main movement routes of the quasi-living - what you’d call the dead. Care to share any observations of your own?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_5">
		<text>That’s just how it is. Some scavenge around the Garbage, picking up scraps, while others push deeper into the Zone. Sure, the rewards out there are richer - but not everyone dares. Rookies without experience don’t stand a chance, and without proper gear, it’s a one-way trip.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_50">
		<text>Have you ever had to shoot one of those dead things coming out of the lab? Look at them - they don’t feel pain, they’re not afraid of anything... it’s like there’s nothing left in their heads at all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_51">
		<text>I'm gonna go get a job at the lab! ... Alright, relax, man - just joking. Once you’re in there, you’re done for. Best case? You die quick.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_52">
		<text>I'm warning you - don’t go into the lab. But hey, if you’re dead set on it, I won’t stop you. Just don’t expect to come back alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_53">
		<text>Listen, I need to warn you - you really shouldn’t go near the lab. No one should. What happens there causes severe, irreversible changes to both your mind and body.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="dm_action_info_54">
		<text>Whoa there! Let me enlighten you - save your poor, lost soul. Alright, listen up: don’t go skiing out to the center of the lake. It’s seriously messed up out there. People vanish, and sometimes... they come back. At night. But this isn’t some vampire tale - these are dead men’s stories. That’s just how it is.</text>
	</string>



	<string id="dm_action_info_55">
		<text>Have you seen those brainy types in their UN-blue gear? Lately, they’ve been spooked. They barely step off their base without bringing an entire regiment - APCs, helicopters, the whole show - just to guard them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_56">
		<text>What’s it to you? Don’t bother them with dumb questions, and they won’t bother you either.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_57">
		<text>You see, we usually don’t leave the bunkers without proper security - conditions out here just don’t allow it. I’m something of an exception; I’m not a fan of big expeditions, all the commotion, or the military presence. But I’m afraid I don’t have anything useful to tell you just yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_58">
		<text>I'm in love with our funny science! I'm crazy about her, man! She doesn't usually come out of her bunker. But if she does, like she did the other day, it's like, "Oh, my God! There's a lot of troops, choppers, armored vehicles! It would be great if they brought a battleship here, or an armored train, at least... (start here for your second session on 7/4/25 and don't forget to remove this reminder when you start)</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_59">
		<text>I've been here for three days now, watching. The lab's here, right? No one's been in it since the beginning, Duty only cleaned the dead from the top, and now they've stopped even now, right? But science has started going in there. So they found a way to defend themselves, I don't know what against. So I thought I'd find out. I bet there's a lot of loot in that place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_6">
		<text>Beasts have been coming out of the Dark Valley in packs lately. I don't know what's driving them out of there, but they're scurrying around like a fire. And in the eastern sector, the mutants are like bedbugs, we only have time to shoot them. That's the news.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_60">
		<text>What are you looking for? You're going to the lab, too? Did you hear that story about miraculous instruments and scattered artifacts? Fuck... When are you assholes gonna get a new lease on life?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_61">
		<text>I work here, young man. Just working, doing my duty to science and humanity. And if you want to know about the abandoned laboratory, in the knowledge of the secrets of which I am suspected by every stalker I meet, I'll answer... I don't know and I don't want to know! I'm not interested in this subject and never have been, do you understand?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_62">
		<text>Maybe the scientists have invented a device, don't you know? I wonder what's hidden in that lab. Even if there's no good stuff, it's still interesting!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_63">
		<text>I'm thinking of going to Freedom? Why not? They seem to be smart people, and even if they're a little careless, it's even better! I don't need to be disciplined, I know what to do, I've been here for months...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_64">
		<text>I saw an old man in the hills. With a huge dog. What's he doing there?</text>
	</string>


	<string id="dm_action_info_65">
		<text>I'm meeting a fellow Dugovian. We're talking. He's a smart guy, but he's as narrow-minded as your tank. You see, we have a different philosophy. The zone can only be tamed, assimilated, not destroyed. That requires open access to all information. Someone will come up with something useful sooner or later. And they - close, forbid, do not disclose... They're assholes, for God's sake, assholes! On the other hand, it's understandable! When the whole state machine is behind you, you don't have to think too much.</text>
	</string>


	<string id="dm_action_info_66">
		<text>There's a hamlet here, it used to be quiet, but now some crap has broken out. It's better to make a detour, so I'm taking a detour... Look, I warned you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_67">
		<text>You, stalker, I want to warn you right away. In the village long ago nested bloodsuckers, and maybe even worse, so be careful.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_68">
		<text>What's new? There are no artifacts here for a long time, and those houses over there used to be inhabited by bloodsuckers, and we shot them off as best we could. Now I'm here, and I can't get to the place. Intuition or something, but I can't go there, that's all. I can't. It's dead out there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_69">
		<text>I'm getting the hell out of here. I've done four weeks at the barrier, and that's it. I'm done. Woodpecker's coming in 24/7, and it's getting more and more aggressive every day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_7">
		<text>A lot of people are becoming garbage men now. Before, they didn't look in the piles at all - radiation so strong it'd boil your balls in half an hour. But now, when the loot is tight, they wrap themselves in protection, take chemistries, and nothing, they look for it. There's a lot of stuff there, though it's mostly small stuff.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_70">
		<text>If you're coming with us, I respect you. If not, get out of sight! We need real men, not assholes. We got enough of our own.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_71">
		<text>You're on the roadblock, man? It's good, at least one more normal person will show up. We organized this thing and kept it going pretty good. but then the beasts came in! It's hard now, so we need every gun we can get!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_72">
		<text>Keep your eyes open, kid. There's radiation and fanatics. Now let's go about our business.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_73">
		<text>You should have waited, stalker. You wouldn't run after everybody! Tell me something. Do you know what's in there? That's right, you don't. You don't know if there's something to eat or not. You don't know what the traps are, either. So why are you guys rushing around like a herd of elk?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_74">
		<text>The way to the center is clear, understand?! Now we're going straight to the center. Now everyone's going to come in in droves. The main thing is to be among the first, to squeeze out the most juice...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_75">
		<text>Go ahead, you'll see for yourself! You don't want to see for yourself what's going on down there? Well, then, you're just... There must be so much there! You've heard of Wishful Thinking, haven't you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_76">
		<text>They're like children, for God's sake! Wish granter, Klondike of artifacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_77">
		<text>I want to see what's over the horizon, man. Maybe we can find an explanation for all this bullshit they call the Zone in one fell swoop.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_78">
		<text>Have you seen the high-rises? That's Pripyat. Right behind it is the power plant. I wish I could go there. But we don't know what's out there in those buildings right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_79">
		<text>I'm explaining! There's Pripyat. Beyond Pripyat is Chernobyl. We don't know what's going on there and who's living there. This is where we belong. We'll find something to clean up, as always!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_8">
		<text>I don't know! I'm on my way to the bar to meet some people. You've never been there before? Oh, come on! That's it! As you stand, you're going straight north. Before you can take two steps, there'll be a bar right there. It's a good place to go, and for newbies like you, it's a doctor's appointment. Experienced guys hang out there, they'll tell you what to do. The only thing is that our guys from Duty will meet you on the way... Well, whether they like you or not, it's up to them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_80">
		<text>Pripyat! Shit, pinch me! Finally! It's just a short walk to the power plant. I don't know who you'll meet here now, what kind of animal is sharpening its teeth at you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_81">
		<text>Hey, buddy, listen. Is that voice in your head too, or am I the only one who's crazy? It just keeps on talking and talking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_82">
		<text>Shit, another one. Alright! For the tenth time, I'm explaining the kind of telepathic influence people are subjected to here. Unheard from the outside voices constantly call them to the center of the Zone and promise to fulfill any wish of the one who manages to touch... as it... yes - some kind of Monolith!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dm_action_info_83">
		<text>Can you hear the voice? It's cool, it's like a record player in your head! Too bad it's the same track. Come to me and you'll be happy. He's been saying the same thing for two hours...</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dm_action_info_84">
		<text>Can't you guess? You're trying to get to the power plant yourself! So are we, what other news?! If only we could get those possessed assholes out of the way...</text>
	</string>


	<string id="dm_action_info_85">
		<text>The power plant area is right next door. what else does that tell you?</text>
	</string>


	<string id="dm_action_info_86">
		<text>There it is, ChNPP, just a stone's throw away... It's all we have left, but these bitches are stubborn, they won't let us in! It's alright, we'll cover them.</text>
	</string>


	<string id="dm_action_info_9">
		<text>Listen, friend! You don't know about the Agroprom yourself? I wanted to go there, and people laughed at me. No, they say it's gone to shit, it's been stripped clean back then, only anomalies left. Do you know if they're telling the truth or just for laughs? I'm new here, I believe it if the locals say it's true. Maybe they're joking. They're just having a laugh, those pests!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_94">
		<text>Wait! Hurry up, but don't be in a hurry! There's Monolithians around here. They know the city from top to bottom, they've set up ambushes. Be careful!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_95">
		<text>I'm warning you! So far, most of the city is controlled by the Monolith faction. A lot of ambushes, they know the place like the back of their hand. Keep your eyes open and check your weapons.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_96">
		<text>What I'd love to do is carpet bomb this town. Bastards. Unless they're in sandboxes and flowerpots. People have already died because of these assholes!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_97">
		<text>Look, I don't know what the hell this Monolith is. Maybe it's not eternal, so there won't be enough for everyone? What are we supposed to do, stand on four points? If we get there, you'll be behind me, I promise...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_action_info_98">
		<text>Duty must break through to the center, if not first, then among the first! Just imagine, stalker, that some psycho - and you're all almost so-and-so, schizo, paranoid and oligophrenic - gets to the shit that really can fulfill any wish. Ah? Then what?!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dm_action_info_99">
		<text>I don't feel like talking.</text>
	</string>

As if the Zone - a living organism and that it should not be interfered with devices, they say that man is well equipped by nature and can safely be in the Zone without any unnecessary equipment. True, they carry automatic rifles with them, assholes. Would not have teeth and claws to tear up the enemies if they are so tough. Although, as far as I know, they do not die in the Zone as much as expected. So maybe they're right. But I personally have not met any of these druids.

		<text>It's a strange day today. Global bad luck is magically replaced by incredible good luck. It's a strange place I've come across. Weird.
...It all started yesterday, when out of the bushes and foggy evening gloom the silhouette of a large wooden house with a sagging roof in several places appeared in front of me. It looked like it used to be a village school and then some kind of hospital. It looked like a dead dragon. And where there's a dragon, there's gold," a misplaced thought popped into my head. Cheering myself up thus, I went in through the sprawling, rotten door. The dining room. Another unfamiliar odor pierced among the usual pile of rottenness and desolation. I redouble my caution, carefully inspecting every corner. 
And I fall. I fall very unpleasantly, on my sore leg. A couple minutes later, I come to my senses. As it happens, I've fallen into the basement. But. How could I not have noticed a hole two meters by one and a half meters in the floor? Fantastic bad luck. It's time to get out, though my leg hurts like hell, and I hit my head pretty hard. I managed to get to the ladder to the top. I crawl up and I can't believe it! At the top of the stairs, there's a KPPU! A universal first aid kit! Only military and special forces are equipped with such complexes. Finding such a thing in the Zone is like finding a thirsty source in the desert. I'm falling in. A few injections and it's almost fine: fatigue and bad mood have disappeared, and I can use my leg almost freely. In general, we can live. Let's move on.
Second floor. I step carefully: the steps and the wooden floor can hardly hold me. Out of the corner of my eye I notice a glint at the end of the corridor. I approach slowly. A door. What could be shining here? I don't see anything. I try to open the door: it yields, but with difficulty. I push harder. It moves a little more, like it's being held by a powerful spring. I slung my automatic behind my back and put my whole body on it. The door felt like lead, I only moved it a couple of centimeters! What the hell is this? I put my feet on the jamb and pressed as hard as I could. It's yielding, bitch! It's like someone let go of the door and I hit the floor. I lay there, cursing the door, resting. I just tried to get up, and it slammed! I flew two meters to the opposite wall of the corridor. That's it, I've had enough! I put a line into the door: splinters flew, slanting and dusty rays of sunlight broke through the holes. I even admired it, even though my rage was off the scale. I kicked open the door, and fell into the room, a former classroom now filled with broken beds. I look around. There's a body lying in the aisle between the beds. A military stalker. Ex. A long time ago, already well rotted. I was a bit stunned to see such a thing. The soldier was fully equipped (I had already calculated the value of all this stuff). There were a couple of questions. Not even a couple, but three. How did he end up here alone? Why had he left the first aid kit downstairs? And finally, the main one. Who killed you, you sick bastard?

Weird day today. Global bad luck magically turns into incredible good luck. Very strange. But you gotta take it while it's good. And run while it's still quiet. I bend over the corpse. His eyes are open, it's like he's looking at me. No, he's looking at me! Quietly turns his head in my direction. I hit him with the butt of my gun. The machine gun flies through the body as if it doesn't exist and crashes to the floor with all its might. I lose my balance and fall on my side. What's going on? The wreckage of the beds stirred and began to shift. I'm going to get hit! What the hell...

... It burst like a liquid balloon. Filled the whole room with his juice. So funny in its will to live - it scratches at the rusty bars that pierced it, wheezes something. Well, the day wasn't wasted - it was amusing to watch this miserable lump of flesh come here for its own filthy greed. Well, what he came with, he died with. It's a kind of justice, too.

		<text>Nowadays, everyone is his own craftsman. So they do what they want.
What was it like in the old days? Experts were respected, people came for advice. And there were more of us
more of us. And now what? It's just me and Semyon the gunsmith and a bunch of small cops, 
who, to be honest, don't have a clue. They're putting optics on a gun. What an idea.
I remember when there used to be more unique weapons. Not the kind that could twist seven barrels into one, but guns with a deeper meaning.
I'm sure you've heard the stories about the self-defeating shotgun. Well, I've held this shooting complex myself.
 First of all, it's not a shotgun. It's an FN2000-based rifle system. But the only things left from the base are the trigger mechanism (and that has been remodeled), the barrel, and the grenade launcher. The case, electronics, optics - everything was redesigned. The essence of these modifications... Roughly speaking, the Optical Targeting System was taken, the one that our soldiers can't bring to their senses lately. And refined it. How Micah managed to cram it into such a compact case, and with good protection against interference - I can't imagine. He was such a master. And the main thing. On the basis of this compact OSC (control element), he built in an automatic firing system. That's so simple and ingenious! You set the firing mode, point it at the target, it automatically opens fire. He called it a self-timer. When we tested it, I was amazed. Target engagement is almost one hundred percent, no malfunctioning of the sight when pulling the trigger, not to mention saving ammunition! Just aim carefully and don't forget to reload in time. Yes, and in the disconnected state, the complex works with ordinary optics, no inconvenience.
Micah gave it to Black. Black wasn't the last master either, even though he was a stalker. Half a year ago, he died in the Zone. Eternal memory. So the Zone got his self-breaker. That's where we should look. And to make a second one. Think about it. Militaries put such EWS on helicopters, and even then, without a hundred percent guarantee of triggering. No, it won't work. If we could find the prototype itself, and dig in properly... 
Uh-huh.</text>

		<text>I go to the peddler, and he says: until you pay off your debt, I'll keep your AK.
Fucking asshole! How can I work off my debt without a gun? Am I going into the zone with a bare ass? But I took a couple of TT's, some smokes, food for a week and went. Last raid, a guy showed me where an abandoned research institute was, but he scared me so much that I shouldn't go there. But if it's a research institute, there must be a lot of stuff there, right? So I went.
... to the site. The woods come right up to the fence, very convenient. I cross over, and beyond the fence, the yard is strangely clean. I cautiously approach the door, turn the knob...
... Damn stairs! What idiot designed this research institute? Nothing but stairs, corridors, passages. A couple more flights of stairs and I'll die. Good thing I thought to bring a kapron cord, I've already unwound 300 meters. What the hell is that door? Ugh, I'm on the roof! Well, what's that lying there? (Here the guy stopped talking, swallowed convulsively. I asked again: "Well, what was lying there?")
- An AK with a double horn. I remember I was terribly happy, even jumping for joy that I wouldn't have to pay back my debt. 
- And was it only an AK?
- No, not only.
...I saw a package lying nearby. Something big wrapped in roofing felt. I started to unwrap it, stupid me, and as soon as I unwrapped it, it turned me inside out! I wondered why there was such a sweet-smelling smell here. It was a corpse! Not even a corpse, but a real dismemberment. The body was almost cut into pieces, the skull was cut open... I got off the roof quickly, yanked back up the ladders, thanks to the cord, I ran to the door to the yard... And there's no door! That is, I can see it, but I feel the wall with my hand! Then I remembered, thank God, that at first the door seemed to be in another place, I started to fumble around, OPAH! There it is, the door! I find the handle, I open it... And there is not a courtyard, but a sea of some toothy tentacles swaying, the closest ones are also reaching out to me. It's disgusting! If I hadn't drained the starch on the roof, I'd have died here for sure. And then, like an epiphany! I looked closely at these tentacles - something's wrong. There's no shadow! The sun is hot, but there's no shadow! I realized it was a trick, an optical illusion. I gathered my courage, I thought I was going to die, so I rushed outside. But I didn't see the threshold because of my tentacles, I got caught. And the yard was covered with asphalt. Anyway, the result is on my face. I was still running through the woods, I almost fell into a mosquito's head, but I got out...
That's the story. Maybe the guy's lying. He was drunk as a pig, and he wanted to get to know the road. I checked it out, though. He did owe the dealer, and after that story, he got loose.

Well, they would have made peace in the open, but they've made a mess of things! This case smells bad, that's how it is. On the other hand, old men say they started fighting for a bad reason. I don't think they'll drag us all into some new meat grinder, those office freaks from the Big Land...!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_50">
		<text>Did you hear that? The military's on a roll, they'll be here in a minute! They found out that Woodpecker's dead, they want to grab all the stuff at once!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_51">
		<text>They just got word! The army is planning a large-scale landing on the power plant. My advice! If you want to grab some of the loot, hurry up!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_52">
		<text>It's a total mess! Just when the corridor opened, the power plant started to be cleaned of all kinds of shit, and now the military are here! You have no shame, no conscience!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_53">
		<text>What I don't understand is this. How could the freedom fighters hold out here for a month? Did they wear invisible hats? It's a hell of a place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_54">
		<text>Do you understand what's going on here? No, I respect Miklouha even more now. What's up with that? Four weeks and more to endure, and not to lose any of the guys!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_55">
		<text>Some of us have lost our minds. They were always tough guys, but now they're drooling. It's scary!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_56">
		<text>As we get closer to the power plant, the unknown telepathic influence intensifies. Some are starting to go crazy, others are having disturbances and visions. Maybe now would be a good time to back up a bit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_57">
		<text>Look, people are really freaking out here. Someone sees a pebble and suddenly starts yelling that it's his fucking artifact, that he was the first one to see it, and the rest of us can go south. Another Jar on a cloud shows up with his partners, who disappeared a few years ago... No, there's something sick going on here!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_6">
		<text>The military's doing something. Searching, digging. Before, only choppers flew to Yantar - to protect scientists, supplies and equipment. But now there's an invasion! They've started organizing raids, riding on APCs. We've already seen them on Agroprom, in the Dark Valley, again. I don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_7">
		<text>Somebody tried to get through Woodpecker again. Well, that's the end of it, of course, and that's the end of the man. You ain't heard of Woodpecker? Oh, come on, man! It's the biggest hell in the whole neighborhood! The only trouble is, the horror stories about it are mostly true.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_8">
		<text>Besides bandits, the military has started to come here too. Before, once in a hundred years you'd see a helicopter, but now they're almost all over the Zone. Did they lose something or something?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dm_cool_info_9">
		<text>I want to warn you, stalker. The military has gone crazy around here lately! They used to guard the scientists quietly and peacefully, but now it's as if someone has tipped their tails! They're running around. Your brother's been shelled more than once, and we've had two wounded this week.</text>

		<text>I see you don't know your way around here yet, so I'm warning you in a neighborly way! Don't mess with the military. If you see them, get the hell out of here, because they've got no brains. They'll shoot you first, and then they'll look at your papers.</text>
