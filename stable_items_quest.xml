		<text>A message was found on this PDA for someone named Major:\nR-138, we've got a new job - it comes from our friends at Bloodcall, over by the Anthill. It's a big one. Rumor has it there’s a Frankenstein stalker wandering the Zone - literally pieced together by the Doctor from parts of other stalkers. We can’t get to the Doctor’s hut in the Swamps; the psionic activity there is off the charts. But the creation is still out there, somewhere in the Zone. Your task is to find him and bring him to the Perimeter—alive, if possible. I’ve already passed his description to my men, but you’ve got a better shot at tracking him down. Send me your account number - I’ll pay in advance if you're taking the job.</text>

		<text>A large pile of papers with various entries...\nIn order to ensure greater safety and stability of research operations (following several unfortunate incidents), it was decided to implement a third tier of psionic-treatment for all laboratory personnel - from janitors to lead scientists. Everyone will be equipped with adaptive psionic-blockers designed to prevent disruptions, riots, data theft, and escape attempts.\nMessage:\n...there was a conflict between a group of scientists developing psychotropic weapons and the leadership of Project Cover. The scientists objected to being subjected to the very weapons they were creating. Realizing that psionic exposure was only a matter of time, they began to quietly plan a way to protect themselves - and perhaps escape their fate.</text>

		<text>The development of psychotronic weapons initiated in the USSR eventually led to the launch of the C-Consciousness Project in 2006, with its laboratories located within the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.\nThe project's core idea was to influence the Earth's information field—the "noosphere" - believed to be the layer through which the human mind could be affected on a global scale. A group of scientists, driven by supposedly humanitarian motives - though not without the self-serving interests of the planet’s so-called gray cardinals - activated the generators and began an experiment intended to halt violence, war, crime, and other forms of suffering. However, this idealistic endeavor disrupted something fundamental in the fabric of reality. As a result, nature and its inhabitants began to mutate within the localized area now known as the Zone. Realizing that events had spiraled out of control, yet also understanding that they alone were responsible for fixing it, the experiment’s participants sealed off the Center of the Zone with powerful psionic-fields. To further deter outsiders, they created the myth of the Wish Granter, supposedly hidden beneath the Chernobyl sarcophagus - but in truth, it was a "Monolith" psionic-emitter, triggering intense hallucinogenic visions that simulate the fulfillment of an individual’s deepest desires.\The C-Consciousness group also began using psionic-influence on global leaders to prevent large-scale military incursions into the Zone, fearing such action would destroy the generators - humanity’s last hope of restoring balance. Simultaneously, they pressured governments to restrict civilian access to the Zone through military cordons and stalker patrols.\nSquads were formed from zombified individuals or memory-wiped agents - people who had reached the Zone’s center and fallen under Monolith’s control. These agents were either extracted from the Zone or dispatched to eliminate unwanted individuals, both inside and outside the Zone. This entire zombification and control protocol was codenamed S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\nGunslinger is one of these agents. He had uncovered too much to be allowed to live. Yet, as with any complex system, errors occur—instead of being terminated, he was zombified and assigned to eliminate himself. It is only thanks to his rare resilience to psionic-influence that he remains conscious—and dangerous.</text>

		<text>1. Gunslinger informed me that he no longer trusts the scientists at Lake Yantar. After his trip to the Center, something changed in him. He spoke of strange things happening there. He asked me to come with him next time. I agreed - after his injury, he needs someone watching his back. But first, we have to head to the Dark Valley. The snitch contacted us and said there’s something there that might interest us. 2. Returned from the raid in the Valley. I could smell it was a trap - the military was waiting for us right at the complex exit. Had to take them all out. If it hadn’t been for Gunslinger, I wouldn’t have made it out alive. But we found what we came for. Turns out an international research center was conducting genetic experiments there. We looked for any info on the Black Monolith, but came up empty. We’ll have to check with the eggheads at Yantar - maybe they know something. From here, we head north. I think I’m becoming more like Gunslinger. I don’t trust anyone now. Just him and the Mediator.

Not only were the drugs not distributed to everyone, but biological material is wandering the building unguarded. There’s a blatant disregard for safety protocols. His setup is a disaster—wasting enormous amounts of money on equipment and cooling systems. I’ve already started studying their schematics (don’t ask how I got them - you wouldn’t believe me anyway), and I’ll send copies along with this letter for you to see for yourself. The installation requires a nearby nuclear power plant, so forget about any possibility of mobility. And if it overheats, the whole thing will spiral out of control, scrambling everyone's brains indiscriminately. If you want proper security for the Central Lab against outside threats, use our technology instead. Of course, the final decision is yours. If you prefer to keep a volatile emitter at your side, so be it, Vladimir Mikhailovich. But I won't take responsibility for the consequences.

		<text>...The experiments on the "Common Consciousness" project were deemed successful. Neural binding of five prisoners produced positive results. The resulting entity, known as "Common Consciousness" or "C-Consciousness," initially displayed slightly less cognitive output than the combined intelligence of five average humans. However, it soon awakened, exhibiting intense neural activity and a data processing speed nearly five times faster than that of a normal human brain. The prisoners’ previously erased memories began to resurface... [no data]. Precautions proved inadequate. The research team was unprepared for what followed. Upon contact with one of the sedated bodies from the C-Consciousness group, two technicians and a nurse were immediately brought under its control. Control of the entire research block was established with alarming speed. In a desperate response, the project leaders isolated the block and released lethal gas through the ventilation system. Twenty-eight controlled bodies convulsed as C-Consciousness frantically attempted to calculate escape routes by scanning the memories of its hosts. Although the bodies began to die, C-Consciousness discovered one-way observation windows - behind which a group of scientists had been monitoring the aftermath. Using intense telepathic influence, it seized control of them as well. From that moment, C-Consciousness could no longer be contained. The remaining staff of the underground complex was assimilated, and the power of the collective consciousness increased tenfold. In total, approximately 500 individuals became connected to C-Consciousness...</text>

		<text>Personal - to the head of strict regime facility 1269-bis, Pakhlo K.P.\nKirill Petrovich, once again I am reaching out with a request. I’m interested in a particular individual from your facility - designation: 115, V.D. Krivashin. I would like to receive his dossier as soon as possible, and preferably his full file as well. We are prepared to offer slightly more for this subject than the standard rate for an individual prisoner, though payment will be made only after receiving the copy. As before, we will handle transportation - your personnel at the checkpoint are already starting to ask questions.

\nProf. V. M. Chubko

\nI have no idea where you got access to our prisoner lists, and frankly, I don’t want to know. I can’t attach the file from the archive - there’s an inspection scheduled in the coming days - so I’ll summarize the key details here: Viktor Davidovich Krivashin, born 1968. Organizer and chief ideologist of the religious cult known as the "Gray Brothers." The group was involved in sectarian activity, with documented cases of robbery resulting in fatalities, and instances of cannibalism among its members. Incarcerated since 1996, serving a life sentence. Krivashin is currently undergoing psychotherapy, but our psychologists' prognosis is bleak. I’ll do my best to send the subject your way as soon as possible.

\nSincerely -  head of strict regime facility 1269-bis, K.P. Pakhlo 

\nP.S. Allow me to add the following: the dossier contains almost no information about Krivashin’s past. However, through my own sources, I discovered that before founding his religious organization, he worked at an institute focused on issues of self-governance. It’s likely that after the collapse of the USSR, the institute was shut down and the staff’s records were “sanitized.” But of course, I don’t need to be the one explaining that to you.

\nP.S. 2. The higher-ups are still trying to bury the story about that march of the "brothers" in the capital - doing everything they can to make sure no one remembers it. I assume you haven’t forgotten that incident...</text>

\nDirector of the Research Laboratory Network – S.K. Frankevich
\nHead of Laboratory No. 15, Kiev Branch – I.L. Karteevich
\nDeputy Head of Laboratory No. 15, Kiev Branch – A.G. Lavrikov

\nDecision: The continued operation of Laboratory No. 15, Kiev Branch, is to be deemed unviable. Justification: insufficient funding, partial leakage of classified research data, risks posed to the integrity of other secured facilities, and a general lack of trust in the current staff.

\nNext steps are as follows:
\n- Laboratory personnel are to immediately produce copies of all lab reports and destroy the original classified documents; 
\n- All available documents are to be transferred to Prof. K.P. Chubko; (start here for your second session on 5/19/25 and don't forget to remove this reminder when you start)
\n- All personnel, starting from the head of the Kiev branch and ending with laboratory technicians and cleaners, to undergo procedure B, in order to further preserve the secrecy of developments. The procedure should be conducted at low power (~100 Jigowatts);
\n- In case any of the personnel resists, action should be taken;
\n- Monitor the mental state of the personnel for 3 months after the procedure B;
\n- The results of procedure B should be reported to Prof. Chubko K.P.

Uralov suggested to proceed to the transplantation of the human pituitary gland, but I had to give up this venture. I do not have, excuse me, the qualified Preobrazhensky here yet. The skilled ones are on another level of our sixth laboratory. And the human pituitary gland, Vadim Mikhailovich, is no joke! However, I refused to refuse, but I will not say that this idea will go into a drawer for a long time. In the future, we plan to move on to more serious experiments.
	Unfortunately, the facility you've allocated doesn't allow us to conduct a full range of procedures for long-term concentrated gravitational effects. It just doesn't have enough power. Understand, the other departments get 20% more power. Even Makarov's department consumes more, even though he has only three lab technicians on his staff, and all they do is bookkeeping. Vadim Mikhailovich, please increase the lab's power supply. Tell your people at the plant to start up the new fourth reactor within a month. Believe me, it will speed up the work process.
