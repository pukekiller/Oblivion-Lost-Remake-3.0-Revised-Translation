		<text>A message was found on this PDA for someone named Major:\nR-138, we've got a new job - it comes from our friends at Bloodcall, over by the Anthill. It's a big one. Rumor has it there’s a Frankenstein stalker wandering the Zone - literally pieced together by the Doctor from parts of other stalkers. We can’t get to the Doctor’s hut in the Swamps; the psionic activity there is off the charts. But the creation is still out there, somewhere in the Zone. Your task is to find him and bring him to the Perimeter—alive, if possible. I’ve already passed his description to my men, but you’ve got a better shot at tracking him down. Send me your account number - I’ll pay in advance if you're taking the job.</text>

		<text>A large pile of papers with various entries...\nIn order to ensure greater safety and stability of research operations (following several unfortunate incidents), it was decided to implement a third tier of psionic-treatment for all laboratory personnel - from janitors to lead scientists. Everyone will be equipped with adaptive psionic-blockers designed to prevent disruptions, riots, data theft, and escape attempts.\nMessage:\n...there was a conflict between a group of scientists developing psychotropic weapons and the leadership of Project Cover. The scientists objected to being subjected to the very weapons they were creating. Realizing that psionic exposure was only a matter of time, they began to quietly plan a way to protect themselves - and perhaps escape their fate.</text>

		<text>The development of psychotronic weapons initiated in the USSR eventually led to the launch of the C-Consciousness Project in 2006, with its laboratories located within the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.\nThe project's core idea was to influence the Earth's information field—the "noosphere" - believed to be the layer through which the human mind could be affected on a global scale. A group of scientists, driven by supposedly humanitarian motives - though not without the self-serving interests of the planet’s so-called gray cardinals - activated the generators and began an experiment intended to halt violence, war, crime, and other forms of suffering. However, this idealistic endeavor disrupted something fundamental in the fabric of reality. As a result, nature and its inhabitants began to mutate within the localized area now known as the Zone. Realizing that events had spiraled out of control, yet also understanding that they alone were responsible for fixing it, the experiment’s participants sealed off the Center of the Zone with powerful psionic-fields. To further deter outsiders, they created the myth of the Wish Granter, supposedly hidden beneath the Chernobyl sarcophagus - but in truth, it was a "Monolith" psionic-emitter, triggering intense hallucinogenic visions that simulate the fulfillment of an individual’s deepest desires.\The C-Consciousness group also began using psionic-influence on global leaders to prevent large-scale military incursions into the Zone, fearing such action would destroy the generators - humanity’s last hope of restoring balance. Simultaneously, they pressured governments to restrict civilian access to the Zone through military cordons and stalker patrols.\nSquads were formed from zombified individuals or memory-wiped agents - people who had reached the Zone’s center and fallen under Monolith’s control. These agents were either extracted from the Zone or dispatched to eliminate unwanted individuals, both inside and outside the Zone. This entire zombification and control protocol was codenamed S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\nGunslinger is one of these agents. He had uncovered too much to be allowed to live. Yet, as with any complex system, errors occur—instead of being terminated, he was zombified and assigned to eliminate himself. It is only thanks to his rare resilience to psionic-influence that he remains conscious—and dangerous.</text>

		<text>1. Gunslinger informed me that he no longer trusts the scientists at Lake Yantar. After his trip to the Center, something changed in him. He spoke of strange things happening there. He asked me to come with him next time. I agreed - after his injury, he needs someone watching his back. But first, we have to head to the Dark Valley. The snitch contacted us and said there’s something there that might interest us. 2. Returned from the raid in the Valley. I could smell it was a trap - the military was waiting for us right at the complex exit. Had to take them all out. If it hadn’t been for Gunslinger, I wouldn’t have made it out alive. But we found what we came for. Turns out an international research center was conducting genetic experiments there. We looked for any info on the Black Monolith, but came up empty. We’ll have to check with the eggheads at Yantar - maybe they know something. From here, we head north. I think I’m becoming more like Gunslinger. I don’t trust anyone now. Just him and the Mediator.

The folder contains ten sheets of notes on experiments in the Zone. If Sin's leader locked it in the safe, there was a reason for it. Also in the folder is a draft of a letter, the recipient of which is V.M. Chubko.\n"Returned from testing the Kaymanov unit. Not only the drugs were not distributed to everyone, but also the biological material is walking around the building unguarded. There is a clear disregard for safety. His setup is a mess. It's costing a lot of money in equipment and cooling systems. I am already studying their drawings (don't ask me how I got them, you won't believe me anyway). I will send them to you along with the letter so that you can see for yourself. This installation requires a nuclear power plant nearby, so you can forget about any mobility. And if it overheats, the whole plant will go out of control and will start messing with everyone's brains indiscriminately. If you want to properly secure the Central Lab from foreign elements, use ours.\nHowever, the choice is yours. If you want to have a problematic emitter at your side, have it, Vladimir Mikhailovich. But I am not responsible for the consequences. Next time I will send a formal complaint to the Group for consideration.\nPrikhodko P.S.</text>

The Zuda I was saving for Toad had to be wasted. It's all right, it was worth it. He said that he was running away from someone, but when I asked who was chasing him, he preferred to keep silent. I said goodbye to him today and he went somewhere north. I don't know where exactly and why, but apparently he is going to meet his snitchs there. Before he left, he asked me if I had visited the archives of the local research institute. He was interested in some papers related to the delivery of equipment to the laboratory on the Radar territory. When I'm near, I'll go in and have a look.

		<text>...The experiments on the "Common Consciousness" were successful. The neural binding of five prisoners yielded positive results. The "Common Consciousness" or "C-Consciousness" had slightly less power than five times the average human's intelligence. The "C-Consciousness" awakened, showing frantic neuronal activity and almost five times (compared to the human brain) the speed of information processing. The criminals' previously erased memory was being filled in again...[no data]...the precautions were insufficient. The researchers were not prepared for this type of event. Upon contact with one of the sedated bodies of the C-Consciousness group, two technicians and a nurse from the maintenance staff came under control. Further, the entire research block where the experiment was being conducted came under control with incredible speed. Instantly reacting, the leaders of the experiment completely isolated the entire block from the outside world. A deadly gas was pumped through the ventilation shafts. 28 controlled bodies convulsed while C-Consciousness tried unsuccessfully to find an escape route. It calculated escape options by scanning the bodies' memories. They began to perish, but C-Consciousness had already discovered one-way windows through which a group of scientists watched the aftermath of the experiment. With the help of strong telepathic influence, the group was brought under control and the C-Consciousness could no longer hold anything back. The staff of the underground complex was taken under control and the power of C-Consciousness increased tenfold. About 500 people were connected to the C-Consciousness...</text>

		<text>Personally. To the head of strict regime 1269-bis Pakhlo K.P.\nKirill Petrovich, again I address you with a request. I am interested in one sheep from your farm. Index: 115. V.D. Krivashin. I would like to get his dossier in the nearest future, and preferably also his file. We are prepared to give a little more for this cadre than for an individual prisoner, but this time already after receiving the copy. Leave the transportation to us again - your men are already getting suspicious at the checkpoint.

\nProf. V. M. Chubko. 

\nI have no idea where you got the lists of our prisoners from, but I must say in advance that I don't want to know. I can't attach the file from the archive - there will be a checkup the other day, so I'll write here the basic data: Viktor Davidovich Krivashin, born in 1968. Organizer and chief ideologist of the religious group "Gray Brothers". The group was engaged in sectarian activities. Some cases of robbery with lethal outcomes and cannibalism were observed among the sect members. Here since 1996, life imprisonment. Krivashin is undergoing psychotherapy sessions, but the prognosis from our psychologists is disappointing. I'll try to send you this frame as soon as possible.

\nYours sincerely, Head of strict regime 1269-bis, Palo K.P.

\nP.S. I will add the following from myself: there is practically no data about Krivashin's past in the dossier. However, I managed to learn from my sources that before the emergence of his religious organization, he worked in some institute that dealt with the problems of self-government. Probably, after the collapse of the USSR, the institute was closed and the biography of the staff was "cleaned up". However, it is not for me to tell you about it.

\nP.S. 2. "Tops" of the story with that march of "brothers" in the capital are still trying to hush up the story so that no one would remember about it. I suppose, you remember about this event...</text>

\nDirector of the network of research laboratories - Frankevich S.K.
\nHead of the Kiev Branch of Laboratory #15 - I.L. Karteevich.
\nDeputy Head of Kiev branch of laboratory ¹15 - Ah.G. Lavrikov.

\nDecided: to recognize the further workability of the Kiev branch of the laboratory ¹15 as incapable. Grounds: lack of financing, partial leakage of information on the laboratory developments, threat to the existence of other secret objects, distrust to the staff.

\nNext steps:
\n- Laboratory personnel are to immediately make copies of lab reports. Destroy the original classified documents;
\n- Transfer all available documents to Prof. Chubko K.P.;
\n- All personnel, starting from the head of the Kiev branch and ending with laboratory technicians and cleaners, to undergo procedure B, in order to further preserve the secrecy of developments. The procedure should be conducted at low power (~100 Jigowatts);
\n- In case any of the personnel resists, action should be taken;
\n- Monitor the mental state of the personnel for 3 months after the procedure B;
\n- The results of procedure B should be reported to Prof. Chubko K.P.

In the attachments to this letter you can take a look at the photos of some samples: you can already clearly see the changes in the musculoskeletal apparatus and physiology of the sensory system. I recommend you to look at the results of experiments on transplanting the pituitary gland of African "hyena" to our wolves. Amazing, isn't it? By the way, yesterday I. G. Uralov suggested to proceed to the transplantation of the human pituitary gland, but I had to give up this venture. I do not have, excuse me, the qualified Preobrazhensky here yet. The skilled ones are on another level of our sixth laboratory. And the human pituitary gland, Vadim Mikhailovich, is no joke! However, I refused to refuse, but I will not say that this idea will go into a drawer for a long time. In the future, we plan to move on to more serious experiments.
	Unfortunately, the facility you've allocated doesn't allow us to conduct a full range of procedures for long-term concentrated gravitational effects. It just doesn't have enough power. Understand, the other departments get 20% more power. Even Makarov's department consumes more, even though he has only three lab technicians on his staff, and all they do is bookkeeping. Vadim Mikhailovich, please increase the lab's power supply. Tell your people at the plant to start up the new fourth reactor within a month. Believe me, it will speed up the work process.
