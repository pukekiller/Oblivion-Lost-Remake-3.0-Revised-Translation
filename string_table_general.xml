First of all, the safe itself - I remember there was one in some hut here near the Bar... let's say I put it together. The safe must have a lock that's in good working order, so that no one will steal anything, because here - people are clever and will do anything to get what they need or to get some quick cash. And most importantly, so that no one steals the safe, it should be magnetized to something so that it doesn't go anywhere. Magnetizing it against wall of the house would work, I'll tell you how. You know about the Magnet artifact, right? Only a few people know this: it has a specific property - if you stick it to something, it'll magnetize it, regardless of what it's made out of. Anyway, I'll help you, but I'll need 5,000 roubles for the job upfront. And I'll need four Magnet artifacts. Do you agree?</text>

A group of scientists, guided by presumably humane considerations, not excluding, however, parties with potentially malicious intentions working behind the scenes - starting developing machinery and began experiments that allows, in their opinion, to stop violence, war, crime and so on. This idealistic experiment lead to the deformation of the essence of the universe, the consequences of which lead to the birth of the Zone. Realizing the fact that something unintended is happening, but at the same time realizing that it is up to them to stop the consequences, the participants of the experiment block the passage to the Center of the Zone with psi-fields, and created a mythical Wish Granter, located under the sarcophagus of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power plant, which is actually a "Monolith" psi-installation, causing halluciogenic visions, in the form of the apparent realization of an individual's desires.
 Also, the group uses psionic energy to influence the leaders various post-Soviet states to prevent massive attacks with their armies, which could lead to the destruction of the generators, which still give a chance to return everything to normal. Plus, they force representatives of the authorities to prevent people from entering the Zone in every possible way (military stalkers, cordons, etc).
People who have reached the center of the Zone and fallen under the influence of "Monolith", form either squads of zombie defenders, or wipe their memories and take them far away from the center of the Zone, or send the hardiest to eliminate undesirable people, both in the Zone and outside it. This procedure of total zombification or control is codenamed S.T.A.L.K.E.R., and operatives who are made using this method are designated as such with a tattoo.
Gunslinger is one of these operatives. He realistically learned too much to be left alive, but any complex system can fail, so in his case, instead of being eliminated, he was zombified and sent to kill himself. And only the fact that he seems to have an innate ability to easily tolerate exposure to certain amounts of psionic energy has led me to the conclusion that he is still acting sensibly.</text>

		<text>RGO (GRAU index - 7G22) - hand-held, anti-personnel grenade. This grenade is designed for defensive combat. Like all hand-held grenades, it's meant to be thrown at whatever is trying to harm you. The dispersal range of its fragmentation is 50 meters, and its potential damage radius is 100 meters. The RGO grenade is similar to the F-1 grenade, but it differs from F-1 by the use of a combined percussion and remote fuze, meaning that it'll explode once it hits a hard surface. The RGO's fuze is highly durable, detonating regardless of the surface inclination or position of the grenade. The fuze is cocked 1.3 to 1.8 seconds after the spoon is released, which eliminates the possibility of accidentally setting it off by dropping the RGO grenade unintentionally. If the grenade is not detonated by its percussion fuze, then the grenade will self-destruct by detonation after 3.2 to 4.2 seconds pass once the spoon has been released. If the RGO grenade doesn't use its percussion fuze, then it'll just work like an F-1, RG-42, or RGD-5 grenade. RGO grenades normally have an olive green color, while the version of it that's meant for training is colored black.</text>

\n
"Messer, forgive me. I've devoted my whole life to science. I believed in progress and its good for humanity. I set great goals for myself, but now I see where my actions have led. I didn't want this. I am sorry you have to live in this world, but there is nothing I can do to make up for my mistakes. Go to the North - there you will find the answers to all your questions. Thanks to these papers, I was able to calculate the exact amount of time it takes for the installation that keeps stalkers out of the center of the Zone to cool down. You can turn off the installation by sneaking in to the maintenance lab when it's not running at full capacity. The cooling phase begins at 9 PM and lasts about two hours. But even at this time, the installation is still active, so you can't get close without psi protection.
\n
I hope I was able to help you in some way. Please don't blame me for what I did. But now I can't rest easy seeing the "marvelous new" world I had a hand in. Go North, Messer. You need to go."

\n
"Just got back from testing the Kaymanov rig. Not only were the drugs not distributed to everyone, but the biological material is walking around the building unguarded. There's a clear lack of safety in plain sight. Installing it is no good at all. Also, I've been tallying up the total cost and needs of the equipment and cooling system. I'm already studying their blueprints (don't ask me how I got them, you won't believe me anyway). I'll send them to you with the letter so you can see for yourself. This installation requires a nuclear power plant nearby, so you can forget about any mobility. And if its lockup overheats, the whole rig will get out of control and start messing with everyone's brains indiscriminately. If you want to normally secure the Center Lab from foreign elements, use ours.
\n
However, the choice is yours. If you want to have a problematic transmitter at your side, have it, Vladimir Mikhailovich. But I'm not responsible for the consequences. Next time I will send a formal complaint to the Panel for consideration."

		<text>Controllers are ex-humans with various augmentations done with surgical and biochemical brain changes. They have the ability to control other living organisms using microlepton brainwaves (simply put, telepathy). They are normally dressed in semi-sporty tight-fitting uniforms, predominantly black in color. Here is some general information about what they do:

1. Controllers are completely mute and do not commnicate verbally.

2. They capture and zombify any stalkers that are known to have any important documents that could compromise our work.

3. They will stop any attempts by researchers to penetrate to the center of the Zone.

4. They will control the mutants of the Zone

5. They will set up psionic energy generators to zombify animals and humans.

6. They are generally nocturnal and prefer to operate at night. However, Controllers are quite capable during the day.

All major takedowns are conducted at night.

It's certainly a shame that there has been a complete cessation of any supply. Our lab now works under an autonomous system. Young employees gradually began to go to other places, some of them joined some stalker clans, someone disappeared in the depths of the Zone. Some of them have died trying to get artifacts, and some others have become a sort of a legend in the Zone. Like the Mad Doctor, for example. He was one of the employees of one of the labs here in the Zone, but it was as if he had become part of the Zone. He developed characteristics not found in a normal person. No, he's not a mutant in the literal sense of the word, but there's something special about him. They say he can heal stalkers crippled by the Zone - literally, from bits and pieces. Or even one of the remains of several. He's also supposedly able to communicate with zombies and even bring them back to normal. However, it's also said that he does this very rarely, as he believes that zombies do not want to return to normal life at all. We also had a guy named, uh.. Journalist, I think. He was obsessed with some sort of international conspiracy idea. He was babbling about globalists most of the time, stating that they brought kids to the Zone for some reason.</text>

Reacting quickly, the experiment managers completely isolated the entire unit from the outside world. Deadly gas was pumped through the ventilation shafts. 28 controlled bodies were thrashing around in convulsions while C-consciousness tried unsuccessfully to find an escape route. It was calculating escape options, scanning the bodies memory. They began to perish, but C-consciousness had already discovered one-way windows through which a group of scientists were observing the effects of the experiment. With the help of strong telepathic influence, the group was brought under control and the C-consciousness was held back by nothing.

But who organized the defense is already a mystery. You knew it, but you didn't have time to tell me. What is true about the rumors of wish fulfillment? It's very hard to say. Someone may have gotten to the Sarcophagus and was able to make a wish at the Monolith. But none of these stalkers are alive. It's also very likely that when a stalker makes a wish, a blowout occurs. I don't know if there's any way to get to the bottom of whoever is behind this. After all, that's what we've been trying to do for a long time. As far as I know, you were trying to get to them during the time you became 'thrice-born'. That's what the stalkers call you, right? I don't know what went wrong then. Maybe the Monolith isn't the last line of defense? Maybe, there's another one and we didn't know about it? I believe there is something else that's protecting whoever is behind this. There's something behind the power plant. But where it is exactly is a mystery. There's also something else alluding us: the location housing the device that can deactivate the installation is unknown. In the meantime, I'm gonna try to get in touch with someone I know.

<string id="jurnalist_ab_chsto_privelo_v_zonu_sk">
		<text>You should know, Gunslinger, how many times I've told you this... I worked in a settlement in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone before the Second Disaster happened. I worked for a newspaper. I was typing something for someone then, uh.. I can't remember now, what, and to whom exactly - the Zone erased almost all my memories of the Big Land. I remember some yellow press where some of the articles were personally sponsored by the mayor. And then it started, the first warning bells. Something's happened here with the military coming in large numbers. It's just like what's happening right now. I remember four trucks of soldiers were brought into our village. A two-story headquarters was built in two days, can you believe it? And the mayor was pale all day. I went to the checkpoints - there were already barbed wire and mines at the entrances to the city. They refuse to answer any questins, they say they're not supposed to answer. Even to the reporters, they said. And then... From the neighboring village, the children left. All of them. At night, when their parents were asleep. There aren't even any babies left. The next morning, there's an uproar, mothers are throwing themselves at the military checkpoints, demanding to know what happened. They thought they'd taken the kids. The military didn't know what was going on. What I saw left me with many questions, but no answers. So I went to that village, for our newspaper. I talked to the locals and asked around, talked to internal affairs. Neither of them don't remember anyhing. It's like everyone's memory has been erased. Not all of it, selectively. But about the kids, they don't remember anything at all. Some couldn't even remember their names. The cops, of course, they blamed it on the vodka, because the people in that village drank a lot. But I've been talking to some acquaintances from there who are teetotalers... No, there wasn't a mass drinking party. What did I learn from them, you ask? Nothing useful. I had to wait. And I waited. Children are starting to disappear from other townships. Same diagnosis - no one remembers anything and no one saw anything. Some were able to stay in their home village or leave for another city out of fear for their child, and others stayed in their home village, believing that no one could protect their child better. That's what everyone thought before the Second Catastrophe. The buses came, people started evacuating. You can't imagine the panic back then. They thought another reactor had exploded. Some of the old-timers have been around since eighty-six. They're the ones who remembered how the army arrived the day after the accident, and the evacuation was much more announced after a considerable amount of time after accident happened. And in our case, things were even worse: the military took too long and they didn't evacuate people until two months later. My neighbor, when I last saw him.. he was calculating something. I asked people I know how he's been dosed. We didn't know what really went on here in those days. And from my perspective, the thought occurred to me that if the kids went anywhere, it was to the Zone. There's nothing there that doesn't confirm an overlap between the two events. I decided one night, I'd sneak into the Zone. Just for one day, just to check things out. I got there just before the military had their first breakthrough into the Zone. I watched them all die in anomalies from afar. Some of the APCs had been abandoned. The ones on the road to the center are often found there to this day. I went deep into the Zone and that's it. It's like the memories of the Big Land have been cut off by something. Slowly, so that I didn't notice. There's still something left to remember. Most important: my name, nickname, how to eat, drink, and how to handle weapons. I can still communicate with people, thankfully. And I can't remember the title of our newspaper I used to work for. I can't remember what's been going on at Kiev. What is it, events in the capital - I can't remember its name... It's possible, that the Zone is taking away our memories? Selectively, I think. Takes away some, and fixes others so you can't get them out of your head. I remember I used to be a journalist. I remember the village, my neighbor, the kids. And the same phrase keeps running through my head: find the children. I can't get any peace. And I'm not gonna rest until I find it. It's the Zone that's holding me back.</text>

Inside, in addition to plans of a storage rooms with hazardous biological materials and a list of the institute's personnel, one can find instructions from the head of scientific work:
Due to the fact that some of the test subjects from the Department of Bio-breeding and Eugenics (Head of the Department - L. P. Romaniuk) represent a danger to the staff, the meeting was put together and all involved decided to organize a storage of bio-waste unsuitable for further work. Pre-dead bio-waste that remains after experiments should be transported away from the research areas to the disposal site (Rassocha Technique Cemetery). At the disposal site, the waste should be buried under layers of metal junk and rubble, all of which is in abundance in the Zone. The railroad hangar is to be converted into a bio-waste storage facility for sorting. There is a high probability that these burials near any rivers will cause a marked deterioration of the ecological situation in this region, so water collectors at the railroad facility should be brought to a suitable condition, for water filtration. All subsequent burial and water filtration directives were sent to the railroad facility management.

There are also records of burials and the reception of bio-waste from research labs:
A fresh batch of biological materials from the MedPribor Research Institute has been received and is being transferred to our disposal. For the disposal of the waste, military personnel involved in guarding the warehouses north of the Rostok plant (approximately an hour's drive from the above facility) were engaged. Among other things, we had to ask for five more trucks from the storage garages to transport the waste because the previous vehicles were already contaminated and not suitable for further use, so they will be disposed of at our landfill. For the new machines, everything has already been sorted out, the documents have been signed, and copies of the documentation are in the archive in the main warehouse building. The original documents will be sent to the MedPribor archives next week.

There's almost nothing interesting except that these documents are signed by the technical director of site security after the Second Catastrophe:
After the increase of anomalous activity in the region and loss of communication with a number of northern laboratories (Complex ZX-06, Laboratory Center, ZX-10), the management of the Research Institute decided to evacuate the personnel and preserve the Institute. Any attempt to escape from the regime territory will be punishable by death. All instructions have already been issued to the site security to deal with trespassers. They should dispose of all bio-materials of the research on site to avoid leakage. Further transportation of bio-waste to the Rassokha burial ground for further burial follows. Check the Institute's archive for compromising data and destroy it before the troops arrive. After all procedures for the conservation of the facility have been carried out, Institute personnel should break through to the Laboratory Center, regardless of the anomalous activity in its region to stabilize the experiment and eliminate its consequences.

	No irregularities were observed during the demonstration of the operation of the ZX-08 biological unit with a unique (to date) sample of artificially grown biomass (sample Y-1M). The research department took every precaution in activating the facility: the attendees were given level one safety spacesuits and medical supplies with ampoules of psi-blocker drugs (in case if the demonstration got out of hand). The 1269-bis subjects were exposed to surface psionic radiation. Any attempts to impede our control were blocked on a mental level. Fields with multidirectional acceleration vectors (gravity concentrates) were tested on the same subjects. The results of the experiment are recorded on tape. A copy of the tape could not be obtained, so it's currently archived at the research complex. Among other things, recordings of previous experiments and demonstrations are also there.

There is also a letter to the head of the central lab that apparently was never sent to the recipient.\n"Recently demonstrated to our dear guests was the workings of an artificially grown biological psionic emitter. Everything went well, no comments were received. We are ahead of schedule and have almost overtaken the Kaymanov emitter in terms of power. To do that, truth be told, we had to increase the bio-mass by about a quarter using test biological material, which meant we'd have to go back to Pahlo for everything we needed. Please talk him into another shipment of prisoners from his colony. Subjects for Rainbow are supplied uninterruptedly and on demand, while for our laboratory we have to beg! As if to spite me. I know we're not going to run out of this resource anytime soon, so don't talk about limitations. Speaking of which, I was at their demo recently, in the staff room by the main emitters. The trial information is there, so I suggest you familiarize yourself with it sometime too. Kaymanov just recently had a cooling problem with the rig there.

By the way, I heard that Prikhodko keeps threatening to file a complaint against you. Why? For failing to follow safety procedures during an demonstration. They say the drugs were not given to everyone, and there were holes in the defense. And this installation of yours is, quote, "no good at all - a total waste of equipment and cooling systems". What's suspicious is that your staff performance reports say the exact opposite. I'll stop by after the Center's installation test - I'll look into it personally. And last but not least, I heard a rumor that you lost your papers again on your trip to Pripyat. For the second time in six months. The first time wasn't enough for you?

The last entry was a short time ago, "Gunslinger, I'll be in near the Freedom base. Find me in one of the houses on the outskirts of town. I'll be waiting. Glad you're back. Hurry up. Journalist." This entry was on top of an old notebook whose owner had previously used it as a personal diary:\n

"Strange place they chose for the installations. The soil is completely unusable and terribly radioactive. We had to wear NBC suits, which are usually worn by Chernobyl personnel, to avoid grabbing a large dose. Even now, sitting in the break room, I don't want to take the food offered here. It's a good thing no one's gonna bother you here. Vadim Mikhailovich gave a full tour of the central laboratory. He described the working principle of the plant and its objectives. The sheer scale of it is truly mesmerizing, and my emitter is no match for it. I was particularly struck by its surface generators. We were not allowed to get close to them - the background radiation near them is just off the scale. It's scary to think what the future holds for those who are setting up and preparing these generators now, or their descendants. Vadim Mikhailovich demonstrated the operation of the plant. For this purpose, ten laboratory employees, including Vadim Mikhailovich himself, had to be involved. From the observation post we watched what was happening. Vadim Mikhailovich kept bragging that he would catch God by the beard. This time he didn't just grab it, he ripped it out by the root."

		<text>This extract is from the 42nd meeting of managers of the Kiev branch of the laboratory No. 15, dated September 9th, 1996\nPresent: 

Director of the Research Laboratories Network - S.K. Frankevich.
Head of Kiev branch of laboratory No. 15 - I.L. Karteevich.
Deputy Head of Kiev Branch of Laboratory No. 15 - Ah.G. Lavrikov.

Decided: to recognize the further performance of the Kiev branch of the laboratory No. 15 as incapable. Grounds: lack of funding, partial leakage of information on the laboratory's developments, threat to the existence of other secret facilities, distrust of the staff.

Next Steps:
- Laboratory personnel shall immediately make copies of laboratory reports. Destroy the original classified documents;
- to transfer all available documents to Prof. Chubko K.P;
- all personnel, starting from the head of the Kiev branch and ending with laboratory technicians and cleaners, must undergo procedure B, in order to further preserve the secrecy of developments. Perform the procedure at low power (~100 Gigawatts);
- in the event that any of the personnel resists, action must be taken;
- monitor the mental state of staff for 3 months after procedure B;
- reports the results of procedure B to Prof. Chubko K.P.

		<text>To the head of the strict regime 1269 bis Pakhlo K.P.\nKirill Petrovich, again I address you with a request. I'm interested in a sheep from your farm. Index: 115. V. D. Krivoshein. I would like to get his dossier soon, and preferably himself. They are willing to give a little more for this frame than for an individual prisoner, but this time already after receiving a copy. Leave transportation to us again - your men are already getting suspicious at the checkpoint.

Prof. Chubko V. M. 


I have no idea where you got the lists of our prisoners, but I have to say in advance that I don't want to know. I can't attach the dossier from the archive - there will be a check the other day, so I'll write here the basic data: Viktor Davidovich Krivoshein, born in 1968. He's the organizer and chief ideologue of the Grey Brothers religious group. The group was engaged in sectarian activities. Occasional cases of robbery that have led to fatal shootouts, and cannibalism have been seen among the sect members. He's been here since 1996,  and he's been sentenced to life imprisonment. Krivoshein is undergoing psychotherapy sessions, but the prognosis from our psychologists is disappointing. I'll try to forward this frame to you as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely, Warden of Maximum Security Unit 1269 bis, Palo K.P.

P.S. From myself I will add the following: there is practically no data about Krivoshein's past in the dossier. However, I was able to learn from my sources that before the religious organization came into existence, he worked in some institute that dealt with the problems of self-government. Probably, after the collapse of the USSR, the institute was closed, and the biography of the employees was "cleaned up". Well, I don't need to tell you about that.

P.S. 2. The "higher-ups" are still trying to hush up the story of that march of the "brothers" in the capital so that no one would remember it. I assume you remember this event...</text>

		<text>Vadim Mikhailovich, we continue to conduct tests as normal. We are waiting for you at our farm to admire the results of recent tests. We are already testing breeds with introduced "wild" genes. In the attachments to this letter, you can take a look at photos of some of the specimens: you can already clearly see the changes in the musculoskeletal system and the physiology of the sensory system. I also recommend looking at the results of experiments to transplant the pituitary gland of the African "hyena" into our wolves. Amazing, isn't it? By the way, yesterday - I. G. Uralov suggested that we should already proceed to transplantation of human pituitary gland, but I had to give up this venture. I'm sorry, I don't have a qualified Preobrazhensky here yet. Our experienced staff are on a different level of our sixth lab. And the human pituitary gland, Vadim Mikhailovich, is no joke! However, I refused to refuse, but I will not say that this idea will be forgotten for a long time. In the future, we plan to move on to much more serious experiments.
	It's very unfortunate that the unit you have allocated does not allow for a full range of long term concentrated gravity treatments. It just doesn't have enough power. Get it right: other departments get 20% more energy. Even Makarov's department consumes more, even though he has only three lab technicians on staff and they only do accounting. If you would be so kind, Vadim Mikhailovich, increase the lab's power allocation. Tell your people at the plant to get the new fourth reactor up and running within a month. Believe me, it will speed up the work process.

You should go see what's out there.. but, you know, we're not really in conflict, we don't touch each other, but they're still fucking unpredictable. There's no guarantee they won't attack us tomorrow. See if you can find where they've settled. The snipers that are observing them told me that they're mostly active at night, so I think after midnight you'll have a chance of catching up with them.</text>

		<text>You saved my hide again. This is the second time you've done so? I've lost count, frankly. Okay, now for the main point. I'm never coming back to this house again. Information has surfaced that the military has secured exits to this city, which means that now I will definitely not be left alone after our joint "business" in the Valley. Rumor has it that some merchants are doing business with the army, which means it's not safe for me to be in the city. We'll have to leave the shelter and move north. I'd advise you to move somewhere away from the suburbs, too. But knowing you and your appetite for trouble, I realize that you'll ignore my advice. Those documents we got in the Valley give some insight into the situation around the international research center in the Zone. Until recently, this center did exist, but what has become of it now is unknown. Perhaps it still exists today. We need to find it, Gunslinger. Unfortunately, I don't have any more information about this center. The eggheads from Yantar couldn't say anything - they blamed it all on signatures on non-disclosure and release of state secrets. By the way, if you get a chance, I suggest you drop in on an old acquaintance in the Swamps. He asked me to tell you that he got the medicine you asked for from the scientists. Be careful out there. Stalkers in the bar say that after the extreme emission there, the psionic radiation levels there have become dangerous. Take the other trail. Take care of yourself, for the Zone's sake.\n\nJournalist</text>

		<text>The state commission found no violations during its inspection of the science facilities. The Commission concluded to issue a permit for extension of research works on the territory of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone no later than 02.06.1998. Currently, the Agroprom scientific research institute Agroprom (see Annex ** for a breakdown of activities) is developing equipment for complex devices used in radiation oncology. From the technical data, it appears that the device will be in high demand for patients with "tumor cordis, casus inoperabilis". The main advantages of the new equipment: increased safety measures for both the patient and the treating physician during the procedure, and the record speed of its irradiation procedure. In this regard, we ask to withdraw the research documents from the Central Archive and transfer them to the file cabinet of the Agroprom Research Institute to optimize the reporting work.</text>

The first reports of missing children from the village, which is close to the perimeter of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, were received by the Ivankivka District Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs only the next morning. Neither the distribution of orientations nor the help of volunteers yielded promising results. It was decided by the rescue team coordinators to triple the radius of the search area. 
	"In case the missing children are not found within three weeks, the search will have to be called off," the leader of a group of volunteers in Sector A8 warns us.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have suggested that children may have traveled to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, but military cordon commanders say that no persons under the age of majority have been recorded in the vicinity of the thirty-kilometer perimeter. In response to the lead coordinator's request for permission to search for the children on the territory of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, the perimeter commander refused, citing the territory's closed military regime.
	Photos, first and last names can be seen on the last page. The editorial board of the newspaper "Echo of Chernobyl" according to the rescue group is offering a cash reward for any information on the whereabouts of the missing children that will help the search.</text>

Ivan Lvovich, after conferring with the rest of the group, we have unanimously approved an offer to give you a sample of the anomalous body, as you requested. The body itself is dangerously close to the infamous Helena cap, due to the difficulty of studying it on site. What we've been able to discover about the nature of the crystal is described below. We send you a sample container. The container has a label that says: "Monolith 2."\n*** \n
The crystal was found in the bowels of Unit 4 - it's a body of anomalous nature that has no analogs with officially (and unofficially) known to modern science alloys. The pisonic radiation levels it emits range from ~1200 to ~1500 Gigawatts, which is incredibly dangerous for the life of anyone who comes within ten meters of it. In addition to that, we discovered a peculiarity in the behavior of the crystal: the creation of organic and
of inorganic substances from literally nothing.</text>

		<text>Diary of a Bloodsucker's Habits</text>
	</string>

<string id="ros_bloodsuk_opis">
		<text>In this personal diary that belonged to a stalker who did hunting, you've found very interesting notes detailing the habits of bloodsuckers:\n


		Entry 1: From the description of the intense raid into the Silent Hills: Followed Bull's group from afar. The big man and the rookies entered the village. Knowledgeable people avoid this place, knowing that its inhabitants are dangerous. Very carefully, trying not to make a sound, the stalkers walked around the crumbling wall of the water tower. They came to a low spot between two hills. There they noticed bodies lying around. They carefully moved closer. In front of them was a gruesome sight: disfigured corpses that belonged to two stalkers. The impression of the bodies was as if not only blood, but all the insides had been drained out of them, leaving only the skin, the outer shell. The stunned stalkers staggered back to cover. Meanwhile, from behind, a tall mutant with huge outgrowths on its muzzle silently jumped down from the five-meter wall. His sickle-shaped arms opened to embrace Bull, who stood closer to him. The thug's back felt someone's presence. He abruptly recoiled and turned around at the same time. Too late - sickle-shaped hands with long fingers and strange suction cups on their palms grabbed his abruptly collapsed body. Fainting, the stalker notices a terrifying face, with ugly outgrowths instead of a mouth, approaching his neck. The rookies managed to run away with ghastly screams, leaving their mentor to die. They didn't get far - the frightened stalkers ran straight into the anomaly field.\n

		Entry 2: Bloodsucker. High humidity and darkness create all the conditions necessary to live and hunt. Skin-eating mucus retains its main properties only in a moist environment. Since the bloodsucker has a thermoregulation system that's comparable to the primitive one a frog has, its metabolism is slow, depending on the air temperature. The best climate for a bloodsucker is high humidity and temperatures above 17-18 degrees Celsius. The bloodsucker is a nocturnal animal, the retina of its eye has more cones than the retina of a human being, allowing it to see in the dark and twilight better than in the daytime. In the dark, the bloodsucker's pupils are understandably dilated, so in the light of a flashlight a retina is visible: the so-called red-eye effect.\n
		Record 3: Possible habitat identified:\n
Dungeons:\n1.	Caves
2.	Underground corridors
3.	Basement
Surface:\n1.	Wastelands
2.	Dumps
Premises:\n1.	Factory premises
2.	House premises
3. waste storage facilities
4.	Paddocks
Anomalous zones:\n1.	Radiation hotspots
2. Fog


		Entry 4: An interesting subject for zoologists are the tentacles around its mouth. Presumably these are modified parts of a mouth - tongue, cheeks and mandible. The bloodsucker's mouth cavity disappeared, splitting into tentacle-like branches. They serve several functions. Basically, it is a sensory organ and part of the oral apparatus. As a sensory organ, the tentacles are analogous to the bifurcated tongue in reptiles. Their surface is heterogeneous and on the inner (mouth) part is dotted with many receptors - this is one of the most sensitive areas in the bloodsucker. A bloodsucker's mucous glands are located in the inner surface of their tentacles. The internal structure of the tentacles corresponds to their functional purpose, i.e. it's permeated with blood vessels and nerves. It also has three layers of musculature, allowing the bloodsucker to utilize them as it feeds. When in a relaxed state, the tentacles sway and pick up odors in the air.

		<text>An old yellowed notebook with notes that sheds some light on the first military expeditions to the Zone. Most of the pages are bloodstained or missing altogether. In some places, the handwriting is impossible to make out.\n
	Record 3. 15.03.2007\n
	... The evacuation of civilians from the village took longer than the military cordon leadership had originally anticipated. We're missing five residents. They're all in their mid-twenties. According to eyewitness accounts, an hour after the "incident" the old men took off northward. The major strictly forbade to send any group after them...\n
	Record 5. 16.03.2007\n
       ... We came to a graveyard of radioactive equipment. Lost two boxes along the way. The first one somehow ducked into the curb and all the electronics failed. The second one suddenly stopped in the middle of the road at the entrance to the dump. There are rumors among officers that the enemy is using electromagnetic weapons and disabling our equipment to delay us. The question is: who is the enemy?\n
	Record 11. 19.03.2007\n
	... The major has gone completely off the rails - he suggests that we fortify ourselves in the city and wait there for reinforcements. Communication with the command is impossible - the radio is dead. Vasiliev had been working on it for two hours already; the major gave him a hard slap for his careless attitude to the radio. The scouts went north to the old warehouses. They say there may be survivors.\n
	Record 17. 21.03.2007\n
	... We finally found Vasiliev. Locked himself inside in one of the houses on the second floor. Had to break down the door to get to him. He hung himself. The scouts still haven't returned - the Major is already going to send more men after them. Vasyan offered to volunteer. Says we need to make a detour and go out to the Perimeter. I agreed.

They penetrated through the army cordons, believing that there was something in the Zone, and that this something could bring them riches, fulfill their desires. Slowly they began to bring back strange things from there, artifacts, for which there was an instant race. Scientists went crazy about these things. They paid a lot of money for one of these specimens, not like now. So, the first stories and legends about what was inside the Zone, near the dilapidated nuclear power plant, appeared. One of the veterans recounted a story heard from one of the local stalker old-timers, a story about the Monolith, supposedly fulfilling wishes. What hysteria began here, stalkers gathered in groups and rushed to the center of the Zone, everyone wanted something from the Monolith. There were grim details about the first stalker to reach the Monolith. Back when the Zone first appeared, many people were trapped by it, cut off from the outside world.</text>

<string id="monobar3">
		<text>Most of them died, but there were rare lucky ones who not only survived, but tried to do something about it. One of the survivors was near the station, he saw a strange glow inside. He had no choice, the way back was cut off, so he got closer. He saw something that stood out to him - the pierced roof of a sarcophagus, illuminated from within. He climbed the wall and the insides of the Sarcophagus were revealed to him. There, among the piles of metal debris and charred concrete, rested a huge black block. It was the Monolith. Then the stalker snapped out of his trance and realized that he had climbed into the Sarcophagus - the Monolith managed to somehow control him from a mile away. Terror gripped him, and through the fear, the Monolith's call was monotonous. The Monolith was calling him, and the stalker's hair stood on end. Strange, eerie images of the alien exploded in his mind. We don't know what's true or false in this story.</text>

<string id="monobar4">
		<text>The point is that he made a wish, and it came true, and the Zone sharply increased by five kilometers. It seems that for every wish granted, the Zone eats our Earth. But that doesn't stop the stalkers. They continue to rush inside, carrying to the Monolith their innermost desires....</text>

		<text>There's a lot of rumors about this thing, about the Monolith. Rumors of all sorts. Some stalker told me that the Monolith is something like-- What did he say? The basis of all human aspirations and desires? Something unique that a person strives for... Quin-tez-sen-tsi-ya, my ass. He said a lot of clever things, I can't remember them all. But I didn't really listen to him. He was a regular motor-mouth - everytime he visited me, I'd wish that he would shut the fuck up and get out of my basement. Though, he was right about something. Everyone wants to go to the Monolith. Rumor has it it's something extraterrestrial. I heard it landed next to the Sarcophagus, or it punched through the roof of the Sarcophagus and into the fourth reactor, yeah. That's why a lot of people think it caused the Zone.</text>

He's a bossy fat guy with bulging eyes, and he tends to have a very nasty and mean character. He's also dressed in a tank top and pants, and the stump of his left arm is wrapped in black leather. He has difficulty walking because of his broken legs. There are rumors of rookie stalkers that were killed by him, whom he let go on a deliberately deadly mission.

To the head of the Psi-Barrier project, Prof. Chubko V.M. From the head of the laboratory K.T.S., Prikhodko P.S.
"Test unit ZX-16's report on prohibitive modes."
The tests were conducted under conditions of forced underestimation by a factor of 2 of the emergency shutdown barrier due to thermal overheating. The ZX-16 unit was activated in its normal psionic-field mode, Perimeter Defense. The tests performed showed the appearance of uncontrollable peak-like bursts of psionic radiation and induced fields after 5-6 minutes of continuous operation. The strength of the psionic-field reached values of 50 to 60 percent higher than the design parameters of the installation. In absolute values, the values are 170-190 psiA. The obtained values are not explained by Kasyanov's theory of induced psionic-fields, since the result of psionic-field lowering at the moment of transmitter overheating was assumed. Part of the staff believes that the increase in the temperature of the transmitter due to overheating leads to an increase in the parameters of neural activity of the biomass of the "Ya-1M" pseudo-brain and the brain becomes a kind of a repeater of psionic radiation, not only a source of psionic waves pumping the transmitter. But this claim requires a serious experimental test, for which the team lacks the resources to do. Others claim that after the experiments - they go crazy and don't think much at all. This is indeed a problem - some of the staff will have to be parted with soon. Biomaterials exposed to psi-fields during the experiment unfortunately became unusable due to irreversible changes in the activity of the brain and central nervous system. CT scan and encephalogram data are attached in a separate report. In spite of unexpected and unpredictable results of the experiment on the ZX-16 installation, the results are intriguing, because they give the right to assert that the use of psionic emitter together with "Ya-1M" pseudo-brain can give, in the end, a more reliable result of the "Psionic-barrier" system than similar results of our competitors from the laboratory.
12.12.2007 Prikhodko P.S.
P.S. To continue the research we need a new batch of biomaterials, in the amount of: 10 animal specimens and 10 human specimens from 1296-bis. Please also send additional guards, as it is becoming problematic to hold the prisoners after they've been exposed to psionic radiation. After the last experiment, some of them managed to escape. During the pursuit, the guards managed to eliminate some of them. The rest were driven into a high radiation area and the pursuit was terminated.

To the head of the laboratory, Prikhodko P.S.
Pavel Stepanovich, in my opinion, after the experiments, I've noticed that not only some of the employees, but also YOU are starting to lose your mind - you're a fucking moron using our equipment carelessly. Who gave permission to run the brain-emitter complex under uncalculated conditions? Didn't your grandfather work at Chernobyl Unit 4 in 1986? If the staff during the diaster of 1986 fell under the influence of the "Russian Woodpecker" (there is at least some explanation for stupid experiments there), can you imagine how things would go? The disaster would have been far worse. I can find no explanation for your behavior! The manual says, clear as day, that "it is strictly forbidden to increase the psionic power above 120 psiA." Did you forget about this? Damn it! As a result, you lost control of the biomaterial, and moreover - let it escape. Do you realize how hard it is for me to get prisoners for my experiments? Do you realize the danger if ANYONE gets wind of our experiments? I hope you understand. So please, in the future, don't do anything like this without notifying me personally. I understand a young scientist's desire to outrun his competitors, but keep your head up. Speaking of competitors, the lab at their facility yesterday got the psionic emitters running steadily with only TWO cooling shutdowns per day. 8-30 to 9-45 in the morning and 20-12 to 21-00 in the evening. Therefore, the comparison with your mode (5 min. work -3 min. rest) is clearly not in favor of the installation of your laboratory. The Psionic Barrier should work reliably and without any time irregularities during the cooling period. However, I don't want to upset you, I also think that the complex "pseudo-brain - psionic emitter" is more progressive, intelligent, and the future is behind it. But.. a protective barrier is needed now, so at first it is most likely to use the fully man-made version of your colleagues. Yeah, it works like a sledgehammer - bang and no brains. But, as they say, "without noise and dust", cheap and surly. (just kidding).
Please pass on my congratulations to the lab staff on a Happy New Year and Merry Christmas.
Prof. Chubko V.M. 20.12.2007
P.S. I will make arrangements for the supply of biomaterials shortly.</text>

		<text>Laboratory Order.
In connection with the catastrophic disaster that began on April 12 of this year in the center of the Exclusion Zone around the Chernobyl NPP, I've issued numerous directives. Directive 1: Laboratory staff must copy lab reports and assemble 4 sets of documents, along with destroying the original classified documents. Directive 2: Security must dispose of all biomaterials. Directive 3: Perform preservation of the laboratory. Directive 4:	Prepare to load the experimental program "Shroud of Darkness" into the "Ya-1M" pseudo-brain, as well as the activation of all external tracking sensors. Directive 5: Activate wind turbines and backup power sources, switch the laboratory to an energy-saving mode. Directive 6: Make your way to the main lab in the Z17-45 area in groups of 3. Each group carries 1 set of documents. One guard is assigned to each group. Everybody must wear protective gear. Good luck, everyone.

		<text>Posthumous note, dated April 26th, 2008.
I, Prikhodko Pavel Stepanovich, head of the laboratory, born in 1976, being in my right mind, voluntarily pass away today. I want to explain the reasons why. I hope someone finds this note and passes it on to my loved ones and my colleagues to whom I remained loyal to until the end. Two weeks ago, I signed a mothballing order for our lab. After the events of April 12, the laboratory could no longer operate normally. Communication with the center was lost. Having reproduced the lab result materials, I sent four groups of my staff to the main lab. Some of them will make it, I believe. And the invaluable results of our work will not go to waste. This will benefit our GREAT cause. After this, I was left alone, and I loaded into our brainchild - the "Ya1-M" pseudo-brain, developed by us, the "Shroud of Darkness" program, which was supposed to make our ZX-16 psionic-defense complex inspire any thinking creature within 200 meters, the absolute invisibility of our laboratory, as well as on a subconscious level to inspire unease and apprehension in anyone who tries to approach it - hopefully preventing them from discovering the lab. Anyway, I'll be brief. I don't know why, but it wasn't the program that worked. When I tried to leave the psionic-protected room with the "brain", I received a intense, psionically-given order to defend the facility and kill all uninvited guests. When I woke up, I found myself back in the psionic shelter. I don't remember how I got back. Over the past 2 weeks that I've spent in this room - I've asked myself thousands of times, how could a program we just started developing work? The answer scares me. Perhaps the most fantastic hypothesis of my colleagues about the possibility of self-learning in Ya-1M worked. If so, that monster is probably grinning slyly at me right now. I tried to smash his hull, but to no avail. My PM can't do anything about that armored glass. And all the machine guns were taken away by our guards. The only way to shut down the complex now is at the backup control panel. I trapped myself. We ran out of water and provisions a week ago. If I leave the room - the psionic radiation will destroy me as a person, and my remaining short days will be spent living the life of an vegetable. I don't want this, so I saved the last bullet in my gun for myself.
Good luck to everyone - Pavel.

	<string id="wpn_groza_old_desc">
		<text>The weapon - an older version of the OTs-14-4A Groza, is a prototype consisting of a 9x39mm bullpup assault rifle integrated with a 40mm underbarrel grenade launcher. Its automatic mechanism functions by channeling gas from the barrel, locking it with a rotating bolt. Notably, this prototype addresses common bullpup design issues, such as center-of-mass displacement and the problematic extractor placement near the users face. These problems traditionally make bullpup rifles difficult for left-handed shooters to use, as hot cartridges eject close to the face. The grenade launcher attachment helps balance the weapon, mitigating the center-of-mass issue. Additionally, a unique casing ejection system channels spent cartridges forward through a designated path, ejecting them near the pistol grip on the right side. This innovative solution allows the weapon to be used comfortably by both right-handed and left-handed shooters. This forward ejection method was later adopted in the Belgian FN F2000 rifle. The prototypes closed receiver design also enhances reliability by protecting the internal mechanisms from dirt and debris.</text>

When the target appears in the field of view of the homing head, a stream of thermal radiation enters the coordinator. If the flow is greater than the minimum sensitivity of the coordinator, a sound signal plays. The target is locked on, and the launch tube is opened.\n When the sound signal plays, the missile is launched. The power supply maintains operation for about 40 seconds after being turned on.

	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_emp">
		<text>A localized concentrate of electromagnetic energy. When quiet, it appears as a dull blue-blue flicker. At the moment of actuation, it creates a disturbance of the electromagnetic field affecting any material object in the area of its action. The damaging effect of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is caused by induced voltages and currents in various conductors. The effect of EMI is manifested primarily in relation to electrical and radio-electronic equipment. Does not pose a threat to living things, but can severely damage all electrical appliances. EMP is most often the cause of military helicopter crashes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_witchring">
		<text>One of the Zone's most inexplicable phenomena. It is not known whether this formation causes damage on contact. There is also no information regarding the artifacts produced.

	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_hvat">
		<text>The progenitor of this mutaflora species is not yet known to scientists. Mostly grows in densely overgrown grassy areas, so it is hard to detect. Remarkably, it is impossible to detect this anomaly with detectors. To hit small objects, such as bolts or stones anomaly is also indifferent. Only works on organic life forms. If the subject enters the target area, it instantly collapses, preventing escape. Forms "Thorn" artifacts of various kinds.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_bald">
		<text>One of the Zone's most common anomalies. It represents a region of multiply increased gravity - "graviconcentrate". The type of damage is a gravity strike. Causes severe damage to internal organs, destruction of skeletal bones, and tissue tears. Depending on concentration, tears apart a trapped living creature or inflicts severe damage such as deep cuts all over the body. Forms gravitational artifacts of various types of effects. An anomalous gravitational field in a quiescent state is easily visible by a characteristic sparkle-like glow. There is a rumor among stalkers that anomalies of this type began to be fixed outside the zone. This is of no-nonsense concern to the scientific world, although there has been no confirmation of these rumors so far.</text>

	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_electra">
		<text>An anomalous formation about 10 meters in diameter, accumulating static electricity. A disturbed anomaly explodes with dozens of mini lightning bolts, and electrocution is almost always fatal for any living creature. A characteristic feature of the electra is the bluish mist visible above it during the day. At night, it is easily detected by any kind of detectors or by throwing metal objects.</text>

	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_fuzz">

	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_gravi">
		<text>The anomaly is presumably gravitational in nature. At the moment of activation with a terrible force pulls into itself everything that is within a radius of 10-15 meters. If hit in the center of the funnel there is no chance of survival: the body of both animal and human will be compressed into a dense lump, and then torn at the moment of the so-called discharge. During the entire period of its existence - on average about a week - the anomaly does not change its location; it can be visually detected during the day by the characteristic air movement above it, swirling foliage, fragments of dismembered corpses and a characteristic dark spot on the ground in the center. Extremely dangerous at night, as it is only detected by detectors or by throwing metal objects.</text>

A notoriety is growing around Pripyat - strange animals have appeared on the nighttime streets of the forgotten city. The first missing persons reports are coming in. 

After a bus carrying foreign tourists went missing in Pripyat, the zone was closed to visitors. Several lengthy investigations were inconclusive. There is no doubt - the bus has vaporized in the city, but further investigation yields nothing. 

Locals brought the dead body of a strange animal covered with red hair to the checkpoint. The mutated creature had a humanoid build, small stature, and large black eyes. The mutant has been taken. A few days later, the newspapers in the capital refuted the numerous rumors that the found corpse belonged to an escaped monkey of one of the maintenance chiefs.
