    <text>Yeah, I heard that Rat gave you the keys to the old place. You're telling me to put another safe in there? Well, you can, of course. Only, I think you should understand some of the details. First of all, the safe itself - I remember there was one in some hut here near the Bar... let's say I put it together. The safe must have a lock that's in good working order, so that no one will steal anything, because here - people are clever and will do anything to get what they need or to get some quick cash. And most importantly, so that no one steals the safe, it should be magnetized to something so that it doesn't go anywhere. Magnetizing it against wall of the house would work, I'll tell you how. You know about the Magnet artifact, right? Only a few people know this: it has a specific property - if you stick it to something, it'll magnetize it, regardless of what it's made out of. Anyway, I'll help you, but I'll need 5,000 roubles for the job upfront. And I'll need four Magnet artifacts. Do you agree?</text>

There were three stalkers in the group - two in exoskeletons, one was in a black protective suit, unless of course he'd changed costumes. I know for a fact he's a sniper.

Then, once under, the blowout hit them, and may still be lying there by the railway tunnel in a hole at the Garbage. Maybe I can find something from them that can open up access to the lower levels. You'll need an access code. Toad said that if I got in and found anything interesting and brought it to him, he will pay.</text>

    <text>Not all items found in the Zone of Alienation are safe. Weapons, food, artifacts, objects, everything can be exposed to radioactive contamination.\nAny individual object, even in a backpack, can absorb radiation if you enter an area that has heightened levels of background radiation. Be sure to carry a dosimeter or detector.\nWith a dosimeter, you can check if an object is contaminated. Just look it over in the backpack. If it's contaminated, the dosimeter will beep.\nNow, a little bit about radiation sickness.\nIt is possible to get radiation sickness by staying in areas with high levels of radioactive contamination, or by eating contaminated food. It'll manifest as a permanent decline in health and stamina. On top of that, your vision will get a yellowish haze. The worse the contamination, the higher the negative effects.\nIt can only be fought by taking large quantities of anti-rads, vodka, and some scientists seem to be able to cure this ailment.\nYou can keep an eye on the contamination rate by getting checked out by scientists. They may have already made some sort of diagnostic device.\nToad, 05/21/2007.</text>

The wind is starting to blow. Suddenly, a sea of rats starts scattering away from the power plant in different directions. A man standing with his back to me, shooting rats. Suddenly, the man in the dream shouts out "Gunslinger!". Then the man flinches, freezes for a moment and slowly starts to turn towards me, but I wake up the moment before I get to see his face What does this dream mean? I don't know, but I think it's something I've seen before.</text>

    <text>Anomalies are small areas of the Zone in which the laws of physics that are familiar to everyone no longer apply. Anomalies produce artifacts - various kinds of items with unique properties that stalkers hunt for. Anomalies, along with mutants, are a key feature that distinguishes the Zone from the rest of the surface of planet Earth. Features:\n- spawn artifacts when monsters die in them\n- can be deactivated when spawning an artifact\n- can be deactivated by specialized equipment\n- deactivated anomalies are reactivated after an emission occurs</text>

    <text>Don't worry, and don't you dare threaten me here. The Dutyers have an interest in my work, and I'm not afraid of anything. They'll protect me if they have to. Anyway, you said you came by to say hello? Hmm. You're a stalker, huh? I can see from your face that you're clearly an experienced man, you must have seen a lot. When you're out in the Zone, bring me one of these if you get a chance. This is, so to speak - my main object of study here in general. I've sent a photo of what I'm looking for to your PDA. I'll pay you well for your trouble, don't worry. This thing is rare, it doesn't come along very often, and I need it. Take care.</text>

    <text>Would you believe me if I told you what organization I'm from? Ha, I'm not sure you would. The fact that you got the artifact really speaks volumes about you - at least for me. I think you and I have a business relationship to continue. Here, here's 500 roubles. Anyway, you want to know more about that artifact you got for me? It's not easy to study it. Although it does appear in the Zone, its true properties I do not yet know. All I know is that it's not a simple little trinket. There's something hidden in it, something beyond our understanding. Yeah, something like certainly sounds commonplace here in the Zone, but this artifact is a truly unique specimen in terms of its potential... Tell you what, come see me in a day. I will do some experiments with this sample. Afterwards, if you come back, I'll pay you twice as much for your next assignment.</text>

  <string id="dezint_long_first_3">
    <text>And the fact that even with partial activation, it was possible to do.. something with this artifact. That's what you're going to find out - you need to do a practical experiment. Here, take a sample. You need to do a full activation of this artifact. How do you do that? It's very simple. It needs to be exposed to ultra-high temperatures. I don't know the neighborhood much, so I have no idea where to get a heat source higher than a hundred or two degrees around here. You've seen a lot of things, haven't you? In general, throw the sample in some place with elevated ambient temperature and see what happens. Then report back to me what you see. As promised, I'll pay twice as much as last time. Alright, go, I'll wait for the results.</text>

    <text>We all, in one form or another, try to forget anything that involves strong negative emotions or stress. Otherwise, a person simply won't survive under our circumstances. If the stress is great, or maybe it's the global influences, or geofactors... or..</text>

    <text>However, you are quite drowsy, young man. No, by the external world I mean the world outside of a person, as opposed to their internal world. Although in some ways it can be compared to the Zone as well. So, what makes you so sure that everything you see and feel is actually happening, that your perception is in accordance with the surrounding reality and not induced by this very surrounding reality? Take the zombies for example - do you think they see the world the same way you do?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="prof_labuda_2">
    <text>That depends on how you look at the question, young man. Once upon a time I worked in one of the famous institutes dealing with management problems, we had a modest laboratory there. Actually, what do you know about our perception of information from the outside world?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="prof_labuda_1">
    <text>No, I'm certainly convinced that this is the real artifact... something that doesn't exist. But!

  <string id="naulagerdocent_1">

    <text>What's there to talk about when there's stuff going on here in the Zone? This is where every normal scientist should be. It's certainly a shame that there has been a complete cessation of any supply. Our lab now works under an autonomous system. Young employees gradually began to go to other places, some of them joined some stalker clans, someone disappeared in the depths of the Zone. Some of them have died trying to get artifacts, and some others have become a sort of a legend in the Zone. Like the Mad Doctor, for example. He was one of the employees of one of the labs here in the Zone, but it was as if he had become part of the Zone. He developed characteristics not found in a normal person. No, he's not a mutant in the literal sense of the word, but there's something special about him. They say he can heal stalkers crippled by the Zone - literally, from bits and pieces. Or even one of the remains of several. He's also supposedly able to communicate with zombies and even bring them back to normal. However, it's also said that he does this very rarely, as he believes that zombies do not want to return to normal life at all. We also had a guy named, uh.. Journalist, I think. He was obsessed with some sort of international conspiracy idea. He was babbling about globalists most of the time, stating that they brought kids to the Zone for some reason.</text>

  <string id="naulagerdocent_3">
    <text>They say there are some, but nobody really knows anything. I think there is such an order - a close-knit group of people trying to maintain the status quo. They are also called Angels of the Zone, or adherents of the Monolith cult.

    <text>There is no Monolith. It doesn't exist and never has existed, Gunslinger. And you're the one who told me that when we were on the outskirts of Radar. Obviously, the Monolith is just another psychotropic facility that was built as a last layer of defense. Defense from who and from what, you ask? From stalkers, of course. But who organized the defense is already a mystery. You knew it, but you didn't have time to tell me. What is true about the rumors of wish fulfillment? It's very hard to say. Someone may have gotten to the Sarcophagus and was able to make a wish at the Monolith. But none of these stalkers are alive. It's also very likely that when a stalker makes a wish, a blowout occurs. I don't know if there's any way to get to the bottom of whoever is behind this. After all, that's what we've been trying to do for a long time. As far as I know, you were trying to get to them during the time you became 'thrice-born'. That's what the stalkers call you, right? I don't know what went wrong then. Maybe the Monolith isn't the last line of defense? Maybe, there's another one and we didn't know about it? I believe there is something else that's protecting whoever is behind this. There's something behind the power plant. But where it is exactly is a mystery. There's also something else alluding us: the location housing the device that can deactivate the installation is unknown. In the meantime, I'm gonna try to get in touch with someone I know. I trust him completely to help me figure this out. You, Gunslinger, can try to get into the center of the Zone again. If I hear anything, I'll contact you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="jurnalist_ab_chsto_privelo_v_zonu_sk">
    <text>You should know, Gunslinger, how many times I've told you this... I worked in a settlement in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone before the Second Disaster happened. I worked for a newspaper. I was typing something for someone then, uh.. I can't remember now, what, and to whom exactly - the Zone erased almost all my memories of the Big Land. I remember some yellow press where some of the articles were personally sponsored by the mayor. And then it started, the first warning bells. Something's happened here with the military coming in large numbers. It's just like what's happening right now. I remember four trucks of soldiers were brought into our village. A two-story headquarters was built in two days, can you believe it? And the mayor was pale all day. I went to the checkpoints - there were already barbed wire and mines at the entrances to the city. They refuse to answer any questins, they say they're not supposed to answer. Even to the reporters, they said. And then... From the neighboring village, the children left. All of them. At night, when their parents were asleep. There aren't even any babies left. The next morning, there's an uproar, mothers are throwing themselves at the military checkpoints, demanding to know what happened. They thought they'd taken the kids. The military didn't know what was going on. What I saw left me with many questions, but no answers. So I went to that village, for our newspaper. I talked to the locals and asked around, talked to internal affairs. Neither of them don't remember anyhing. It's like everyone's memory has been erased. Not all of it, selectively. But about the kids, they don't remember anything at all. Some couldn't even remember their names. The cops, of course, they blamed it on the vodka, because the people in that village drank a lot. But I've been talking to some acquaintances from there who are teetotalers... No, there wasn't a mass drinking party. What did I learn from them, you ask? Nothing useful. I had to wait. And I waited. Children are starting to disappear from other townships. Same diagnosis - no one remembers anything and no one saw anything. Some were able to stay in their home village or leave for another city out of fear for their child, and others stayed in their home village, believing that no one could protect their child better. That's what everyone thought before the Second Catastrophe. The buses came, people started evacuating. You can't imagine the panic back then. They thought another reactor had exploded. Some of the old-timers have been around since eighty-six. They're the ones who remembered how the army arrived the day after the accident, and the evacuation was much more announced after a considerable amount of time after accident happened. And in our case, things were even worse: the military took too long and they didn't evacuate people until two months later. My neighbor, when I last saw him.. he was calculating something. I asked people I know how he's been dosed. We didn't know what really went on here in those days. And from my perspective, the thought occurred to me that if the kids went anywhere, it was to the Zone. There's nothing there that doesn't confirm an overlap between the two events. I decided one night, I'd sneak into the Zone. Just for one day, just to check things out. I got there just before the military had their first breakthrough into the Zone. I watched them all die in anomalies from afar. Some of the APCs had been abandoned. The ones on the road to the center are often found there to this day. I went deep into the Zone and that's it. It's like the memories of the Big Land have been cut off by something. Slowly, so that I didn't notice. There's still something left to remember. Most important: my name, nickname, how to eat, drink, and how to handle weapons. I can still communicate with people, thankfully. And I can't remember the title of our newspaper I used to work for. I can't remember what's been going on at Kiev. What is it, events in the capital - I can't remember its name... It's possible, that the Zone is taking away our memories? Selectively, I think. Takes away some, and fixes others so you can't get them out of your head. I remember I used to be a journalist. I remember the village, my neighbor, the kids. And the same phrase keeps running through my head: find the children. I can't get any peace. And I'm not gonna rest until I find it. It's the Zone that's holding me back.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="jurnalist_what_about_childs_sk">
    <text>I know that shortly before the first day, all the children left the settlements near the borders of the current Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. They're probably in the center, on the other side of the Winds of Madness installation. In the South, all the places have been explored by stalkers, but in the north, where there aren't so many people, there may be there. Something happened back there at the center that lured kids to the Zone. Just the kids, not adults. And what metamorphosed them here and turned them into dwarfs is a mystery. I'm sure the center of the Zone also has labs, with evidence explaning what has happened.</text>

Inside, in addition to plans of a storage rooms with hazardous biological materials and a list of the institute's personnel, one can find instructions from the head of scientific work:
Due to the fact that some of the test subjects from the Department of Bio-breeding and Eugenics (Head of the Department - L. P. Romaniuk) represent a danger to the staff, the meeting was put together and all involved decided to organize a storage of bio-waste unsuitable for further work. Pre-dead bio-waste that remains after experiments should be transported away from the research areas to the disposal site (Rassocha Technique Cemetery). At the disposal site, the waste should be buried under layers of metal junk and rubble, all of which is in abundance in the Zone. The railroad hangar is to be converted into a bio-waste storage facility for sorting. There is a high probability that these burials near any rivers will cause a marked deterioration of the ecological situation in this region, so water collectors at the railroad facility should be brought to a suitable condition, for water filtration. All subsequent burial and water filtration directives were sent to the railroad facility management.

In these documents is seemingly endless directives for troubleshooting the water collection system and the list of warehouse personnel, which numbered about a hundred names. There are also records of burials and the reception of bio-waste from research labs:
A fresh batch of biological materials from the Agroprom Research Institute has been received and is being transferred to our disposal. For the disposal of the waste, military personnel involved in guarding the warehouses north of the Rostok plant (approximately an hour's drive from the above facility) were engaged. Among other things, we had to ask for five more trucks from the storage garages to transport the waste because the previous vehicles were already contaminated and not suitable for further use, so they will be disposed of at our landfill. For the new machines, everything has already been sorted out, the documents have been signed, and copies of the documentation are in the archive in the main warehouse building. The original documents will be sent to the Agroprom archives next week.

There's almost nothing interesting except that these documents are signed by the technical director of site security after the Second Catastrophe:
After the increase of anomalous activity in the region and loss of communication with a number of northern laboratories (Complex ZX-06, Laboratory Center, ZX-10), the management of the Research Institute decided to evacuate the personnel and preserve the Institute. Any attempt to escape from the regime territory will be punishable by death. All instructions have already been issued to the site security to deal with trespassers. They should dispose of all bio-materials of the research on site to avoid leakage. Further transportation of bio-waste to the Rassokha burial ground for further burial follows. Check the Institute's archive for compromising data and destroy it before the troops arrive. After all procedures for the conservation of the facility have been carried out, Institute personnel should break through to the Laboratory Center, regardless of the anomalous activity in its region to stabilize the experiment and eliminate its consequences.

	No irregularities were observed during the demonstration of the operation of the ZX-08 biological unit with a unique (to date) sample of artificially grown biomass (sample Y-1M). The research department took every precaution in activating the facility: the attendees were given level one safety spacesuits and medical supplies with ampoules of psi-blocker drugs (in case if the demonstration got out of hand). The 1269-bis subjects were exposed to surface psionic radiation. Any attempts to impede our control were blocked on a mental level. Fields with multidirectional acceleration vectors (gravity concentrates) were tested on the same subjects. The results of the experiment are recorded on tape. A copy of the tape could not be obtained, so it's currently archived at the research complex. Among other things, recordings of previous experiments and demonstrations are also there.

There is also a letter to the head of the central lab that apparently was never sent to the recipient.\n"Recently demonstrated to our dear guests was the workings of an artificially grown biological psionic emitter. Everything went well, no comments were received. We are ahead of schedule and have almost overtaken the Kaymanov emitter in terms of power. To do that, truth be told, we had to increase the bio-mass by about a quarter using test biological material, which meant we'd have to go back to Pahlo for everything we needed. Please talk him into another shipment of prisoners from his colony. Subjects for Rainbow are supplied uninterruptedly and on demand, while for our laboratory we have to beg! As if to spite me. I know we're not going to run out of this resource anytime soon, so don't talk about limitations. Speaking of which, I was at their demo recently, in the staff room by the main emitters. The trial information is there, so I suggest you familiarize yourself with it sometime too. Kaymanov just recently had a cooling problem with the rig there.

They say the drugs were not given to everyone, and there were holes in the defense. And this installation of yours is, quote, "no good at all - a total waste of equipment and cooling systems". What's suspicious is that your staff performance reports say the exact opposite. I'll stop by after the Center's installation test - I'll look into it personally.

"Strange place they chose for the installations. The soil is completely unusable and terribly radioactive. We had to wear NBC suits, which are usually worn by Chernobyl personnel, to avoid grabbing a large dose. Even now, sitting in the break room, I don't want to take the food offered here. It's a good thing no one's gonna bother you here. Vadim Mikhailovich gave a full tour of the central laboratory. He described the working principle of the plant and its objectives. The sheer scale of it is truly mesmerizing, and my emitter is no match for it. I was particularly struck by its surface generators. We were not allowed to get close to them - the background radiation near them is just off the scale. It's scary to think what the future holds for those who are setting up and preparing these generators now, or their descendants. Vadim Mikhailovich demonstrated the operation of the plant. For this purpose, ten laboratory employees, including Vadim Mikhailovich himself, had to be involved. From the observation post we watched what was happening. Vadim Mikhailovich kept bragging that he would catch God by the beard.

Information has surfaced that the military has secured exits to this city, which means that now I will definitely not be left alone after our joint "business" in the Valley.

I'd advise you to move somewhere away from the suburbs, too. But knowing you and your appetite for trouble, I realize that you'll ignore my advice. Those documents we got in the Valley give some insight into the situation around the international research center in the Zone. Until recently, this center did exist, but what has become of it now is unknown. Perhaps it still exists today. We need to find it, Gunslinger. Unfortunately, I don't have any more information about this center. The eggheads from Yantar couldn't say anything - they blamed it all on signatures on non-disclosure and release of state secrets. By the way, if you get a chance, I suggest you drop in on an old acquaintance in the Swamps. He asked me to tell you that he got the medicine you asked for from the scientists. Be careful out there.

    <text>Diary of a Bloodsucker's Habits</text>
  </string>
  <string id="ros_bloodsuk_opis">
    <text>In this personal diary that belonged to a stalker who did hunting, you've found very interesting notes detailing the habits of bloodsuckers:\n


		Entry 1: From the description of the intense raid into the Silent Hills: Followed Bull's group from afar. The big man and the rookies entered the village. Knowledgeable people avoid this place, knowing that its inhabitants are dangerous. Very carefully, trying not to make a sound, the stalkers walked around the crumbling wall of the water tower. They came to a low spot between two hills. There they noticed bodies lying around. They carefully moved closer. In front of them was a gruesome sight: disfigured corpses that belonged to two stalkers. The impression of the bodies was as if not only blood, but all the insides had been drained out of them, leaving only the skin, the outer shell. The stunned stalkers staggered back to cover. Meanwhile, from behind, a tall mutant with huge outgrowths on its muzzle silently jumped down from the five-meter wall. His sickle-shaped arms opened to embrace Bull, who stood closer to him. The thug's back felt someone's presence. He abruptly recoiled and turned around at the same time. Too late - sickle-shaped hands with long fingers and strange suction cups on their palms grabbed his abruptly collapsed body. Fainting, the stalker notices a terrifying face, with ugly outgrowths instead of a mouth, approaching his neck. The rookies managed to run away with ghastly screams, leaving their mentor to die. They didn't get far - the frightened stalkers ran straight into the anomaly field.\n

		Entry 2: Bloodsucker. High humidity and darkness create all the conditions necessary to live and hunt. Skin-eating mucus retains its main properties only in a moist environment. Since the bloodsucker has a thermoregulation system that's comparable to the primitive one a frog has, its metabolism is slow, depending on the air temperature. The best climate for a bloodsucker is high humidity and temperatures above 17-18 degrees Celsius. The bloodsucker is a nocturnal animal, the retina of its eye has more cones than the retina of a human being, allowing it to see in the dark and twilight better than in the daytime. In the dark, the bloodsucker's pupils are understandably dilated, so in the light of a flashlight a retina is visible: the so-called red-eye effect.\n
		Record 3: Possible habitat identified:\n
Dungeons:\n1.	Caves
2.	Underground corridors
3.	Basement
Surface:\n1.	Wastelands
2.	Dumps
Premises:\n1.	Factory premises
2.	House premises
3. waste storage facilities
4.	Paddocks
Anomalous zones:\n1.	Radiation hotspots
2. Fog


		Entry 4: An interesting subject for zoologists are the tentacles around its mouth. Presumably these are modified parts of a mouth - tongue, cheeks and mandible. The bloodsucker's mouth cavity disappeared, splitting into tentacle-like branches. They serve several functions. Basically, it is a sensory organ and part of the oral apparatus. As a sensory organ, the tentacles are analogous to the bifurcated tongue in reptiles. Their surface is heterogeneous and on the inner (mouth) part is dotted with many receptors - this is one of the most sensitive areas in the bloodsucker. A bloodsucker's mucous glands are located in the inner surface of their tentacles. The internal structure of the tentacles corresponds to their functional purpose, i.e. it's permeated with blood vessels and nerves. It also has three layers of musculature, allowing the bloodsucker to utilize them as it feeds. When in a relaxed state, the tentacles sway and pick up odors in the air.</text>

  <string id="monobar1">
    <text>I'm going to tell you a story I tell everyone. It's a legend about the Monolith, quite possibly the cause of the Zone. In 2006, the Zone exploded, measures were taken and the population in the area was evacuated, the Zone was cordoned off by army units. No one knew what was going on, panic all around, the Zone was growing, field labs were powerless. A lot of people died inside. Everyone is afraid of radiation that could cover half of Europe.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="monobar2">
    <text>A few years went by, the first desperate guys like you showed up. They called themselves stalkers. They penetrated through the army cordons, believing that there was something in the Zone, and that this something could bring them riches, fulfill their desires. Slowly they began to bring back strange things from there, artifacts, for which there was an instant race. Scientists went crazy about these things. They paid a lot of money for one of these specimens, not like now. So, the first stories and legends about what was inside the Zone, near the dilapidated nuclear power plant, appeared. One of the veterans recounted a story heard from one of the local stalker old-timers, a story about the Monolith, supposedly fulfilling wishes. What hysteria began here, stalkers gathered in groups and rushed to the center of the Zone, everyone wanted something from the Monolith. There were grim details about the first stalker to reach the Monolith. Back when the Zone first appeared, many people were trapped by it, cut off from the outside world.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="monobar3">
    <text>Most of them died, but there were rare lucky ones who not only survived, but tried to do something about it. One of the survivors was near the station, he saw a strange glow inside. He had no choice, the way back was cut off, so he got closer. He saw something that stood out to him - the pierced roof of a sarcophagus, illuminated from within. He climbed the wall and the insides of the Sarcophagus were revealed to him. There, among the piles of metal debris and charred concrete, rested a huge black block. It was the Monolith. Then the stalker snapped out of his trance and realized that he had climbed into the Sarcophagus - the Monolith managed to somehow control him from a mile away. Terror gripped him, and through the fear, the Monolith's call was monotonous. The Monolith was calling him, and the stalker's hair stood on end. Strange, eerie images of the alien exploded in his mind. We don't know what's true or false in this story.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="monobar4">
    <text>The point is that he made a wish, and it came true, and the Zone sharply increased by five kilometers. It seems that for every wish granted, the Zone eats our Earth. But that doesn't stop the stalkers. They continue to rush inside, carrying to the Monolith their innermost desires....</text>

The basis of all human aspirations and desires? Something unique that a person strives for... Quin-tez-sen-tsi-ya, my ass. He said a lot of clever things, I can't remember them all. But I didn't really listen to him. He was a regular motor-mouth - everytime he visited me, I'd wish that he would shut the fuck up and get out of my basement. Though, he was right about something. Everyone wants to go to the Monolith. Rumor has it it's something extraterrestrial. I heard it landed next to the Sarcophagus, or it punched through the roof of the Sarcophagus and into the fourth reactor, yeah. That's why a lot of people think it caused the Zone.</text>

To the head of the Psi-Barrier project, Prof. Chubko V.M. From the head of the laboratory K.T.S., Prikhodko P.S.
"Test unit ZX-16's report on prohibitive modes."
The tests were conducted under conditions of forced underestimation by a factor of 2 of the emergency shutdown barrier due to thermal overheating. The ZX-16 unit was activated in its normal psionic-field mode, Perimeter Defense. The tests performed showed the appearance of uncontrollable peak-like bursts of psionic radiation and induced fields after 5-6 minutes of continuous operation. The strength of the psionic-field reached values of 50 to 60 percent higher than the design parameters of the installation. In absolute values, the values are 170-190 psiA. The obtained values are not explained by Kasyanov's theory of induced psionic-fields, since the result of psionic-field lowering at the moment of transmitter overheating was assumed. Part of the staff believes that the increase in the temperature of the transmitter due to overheating leads to an increase in the parameters of neural activity of the biomass of the "Ya-1M" pseudo-brain and the brain becomes a kind of a repeater of psionic radiation, not only a source of psionic waves pumping the transmitter. But this claim requires a serious experimental test, for which the team lacks the resources to do. Others claim that after the experiments - they go crazy and don't think much at all. This is indeed a problem - some of the staff will have to be parted with soon. Biomaterials exposed to psi-fields during the experiment unfortunately became unusable due to irreversible changes in the activity of the brain and central nervous system. CT scan and encephalogram data are attached in a separate report. In spite of unexpected and unpredictable results of the experiment on the ZX-16 installation, the results are intriguing, because they give the right to assert that the use of psionic emitter together with "Ya-1M" pseudo-brain can give, in the end, a more reliable result of the "Psionic-barrier" system than similar results of our competitors from the laboratory.
12.12.2007 Prikhodko P.S.
P.S. To continue the research we need a new batch of biomaterials, in the amount of: 10 animal specimens and 10 human specimens from 1296-bis. Please also send additional guards, as it is becoming problematic to hold the prisoners after they've been exposed to psionic radiation. After the last experiment, some of them managed to escape. During the pursuit, the guards managed to eliminate some of them. The rest were driven into a high radiation area and the pursuit was terminated.

To the head of the laboratory, Prikhodko P.S.
Pavel Stepanovich, in my opinion, after the experiments, I've noticed that not only some of the employees, but also YOU are starting to lose your mind - you're a fucking moron using our equipment carelessly. Who gave permission to run the brain-emitter complex under uncalculated conditions? Didn't your grandfather work at Chernobyl Unit 4 in 1986? If the staff during the diaster of 1986 fell under the influence of the "Russian Woodpecker" (there is at least some explanation for stupid experiments there), can you imagine how things would go? The disaster would have been far worse. I can find no explanation for your behavior! The manual says, clear as day, that "it is strictly forbidden to increase the psionic power above 120 psiA." Did you forget about this? Damn it! As a result, you lost control of the biomaterial, and moreover - let it escape. Do you realize how hard it is for me to get prisoners for my experiments? Do you realize the danger if ANYONE gets wind of our experiments? I hope you understand. So please, in the future, don't do anything like this without notifying me personally. I understand a young scientist's desire to outrun his competitors, but keep your head up. Speaking of competitors, the lab at their facility yesterday got the psionic emitters running steadily with only TWO cooling shutdowns per day. 8-30 to 9-45 in the morning and 20-12 to 21-00 in the evening. Therefore, the comparison with your mode (5 min. work -3 min. rest) is clearly not in favor of the installation of your laboratory. The Psionic Barrier should work reliably and without any time irregularities during the cooling period. However, I don't want to upset you, I also think that the complex "pseudo-brain - psionic emitter" is more progressive, intelligent, and the future is behind it. But.. a protective barrier is needed now, so at first it is most likely to use the fully man-made version of your colleagues. Yeah, it works like a sledgehammer - bang and no brains. But, as they say, "without noise and dust", cheap and surly. (just kidding).
Please pass on my congratulations to the lab staff on a Happy New Year and Merry Christmas.
Prof. Chubko V.M. 20.12.2007
P.S. I will make arrangements for the supply of biomaterials shortly.</text>

    <text>Laboratory Order.
In connection with the catastrophic disaster that began on April 12 of this year in the center of the Exclusion Zone around the Chernobyl NPP, I've issued numerous directives. Directive 1: Laboratory staff must copy lab reports and assemble 4 sets of documents, along with destroying the original classified documents. Directive 2: Security must dispose of all biomaterials. Directive 3: Perform preservation of the laboratory. Directive 4:	Prepare to load the experimental program "Shroud of Darkness" into the "Ya-1M" pseudo-brain, as well as the activation of all external tracking sensors. Directive 5: Activate wind turbines and backup power sources, switch the laboratory to an energy-saving mode. Directive 6: Make your way to the main lab in the Z17-45 area in groups of 3. Each group carries 1 set of documents. One guard is assigned to each group. Everybody must wear protective gear. Good luck, everyone.

    <text>Posthumous note, dated April 26th, 2008.
I, Prikhodko Pavel Stepanovich, head of the laboratory, born in 1976, being in my right mind, voluntarily pass away today. I want to explain the reasons why. I hope someone finds this note and passes it on to my loved ones and my colleagues to whom I remained loyal to until the end. Two weeks ago, I signed a mothballing order for our lab. After the events of April 12, the laboratory could no longer operate normally. Communication with the center was lost. Having reproduced the lab result materials, I sent four groups of my staff to the main lab. Some of them will make it, I believe. And the invaluable results of our work will not go to waste. This will benefit our GREAT cause. After this, I was left alone, and I loaded into our brainchild - the "Ya1-M" pseudo-brain, developed by us, the "Shroud of Darkness" program, which was supposed to make our ZX-16 psionic-defense complex inspire any thinking creature within 200 meters, the absolute invisibility of our laboratory, as well as on a subconscious level to inspire unease and apprehension in anyone who tries to approach it - hopefully preventing them from discovering the lab. Anyway, I'll be brief. I don't know why, but it wasn't the program that worked. When I tried to leave the psionic-protected room with the "brain", I received a intense, psionically-given order to defend the facility and kill all uninvited guests. When I woke up, I found myself back in the psionic shelter. I don't remember how I got back. Over the past 2 weeks that I've spent in this room - I've asked myself thousands of times, how could a program we just started developing work? The answer scares me. Perhaps the most fantastic hypothesis of my colleagues about the possibility of self-learning in Ya-1M worked. If so, that monster is probably grinning slyly at me right now. I tried to smash his hull, but to no avail. My PM can't do anything about that armored glass. And all the machine guns were taken away by our guards. The only way to shut down the complex now is at the backup control panel. I trapped myself. We ran out of water and provisions a week ago. If I leave the room - the psionic radiation will destroy me as a person, and my remaining short days will be spent living the life of an vegetable. I don't want this, so I saved the last bullet in my gun for myself.
Good luck to everyone - Pavel.

  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_acidfog">
    <text>This anomaly has gotten its name because of the characteristic damage that it inflicts on people or objects when anything enters it. Visually, it resembles a bright purple shimmer in the air.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_roundabout">
    <text>The anomaly snatches its victims up in the air and spins them at a breakneck speed. The exact nature of the Whirligig remains unknown. The anomaly can be recognized by a light whirlwind of dust above and by body fragments scattered in the vicinity. Victims caught on its outer rim - far enough from the maximum effect zone at the center - can escape the Whirligig with relatively minor injuries.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_ameba">
    <text>The origin or nature of this anomaly is not clear. When it comes into contact with human flesh, it causes severe injuries similar to the effects of strong acid.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_emp">
    <text>This anomaly is a concentration of of electromagnetic energy.  When at rest, it appears as a dull blue-blue shimmer. When it triggers, it creates a disturbance of the electromagnetic field, which negatively affects any objects that can be damaged by an EMP burst. The damaging effect of an electromagnetic pulsed is caused by the occurrence of induced voltages and currents in various conductors.  The effect of EMR manifests itself primarily in electronics, such as PDA's or computers, and radio equipment  It does not pose a threat to living beings, but it can seriously damage any electronics within its range.  Most often, it is EMP anomaly that causes military helicopters to crash.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_witchring">
    <text>One of the most inexplicable phenomena discovered in the Zone. It's not known for certain whether this anomaly causes damage if anything (or anyone) comes into contact with it. There is also no information about the artifacts that it produces. Numerous groups of people are trying to study this anomaly: not only scientists, the black market that was spawned by the Zone is also showing great interest.  There are also rumors that anyone who comes into physical contact with this anomaly has their fertility - numerous stalkers have attested this.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_birthmark">
    <text>This anomaly is one of the more aggressive plant-based hazards that stalkers have encountered. It seems to be mostly composed out of moss. Birthmarks do not have a fixed shape; if anyone - or anything approaches it too closely, it digs into its victim with its shoots, causing serious damage to any exposed skin. Scientists have not yet established what artifacts this anomaly forms.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_hvat">
    <text>One of the first anomalies encountered in the Zone. Generally speaking, these half-floral, half-faunal mutants appeared long before the Second Catastrophe. Most probably they are the result of radioactive pollution of the area after the Chernobyl disaster. Still, the fact that the "Grasspers" are mostly encountered in the Agroprom Research Institute area indirectly indicates human influence on their birth. The anomaly itself resembles a huge predator plant like "Sundew" or "Venus flytrap". It can often be encountered by water ponds and other plants tangles, in which the "Grassper" camouflages easily due to its protective coloration. But the anomaly can be effortlessly detected by the great amount of flies near it, which feed on the remains of its victims. The "Grassper" is extremely dangerous - it is very difficult to break free out of its closed tentacles.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_bald">
    <text>One of the first anomalies ever recorded - an unstable gravitational field inflicting shock damage to anyone within its radius. Remains active for a week on average. The amount of damage inflicted changes during its lifetime, ranging from minor bruises, through serious wounds, to instant death. Easy to spot in daylight. Accompanied by air fluctuation above the anomaly, dancing leaves and distinctive crimson-colored stains on the ground. Picked up by all types of detectors, the Springboard can also be revealed by throwing objects into it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_electra">
    <text>An anomalous formation, roughly 10 meters in diameter, accumulating large quantities of static electricity. When triggered, the anomaly bursts out in dozens of miniature lightnings, causing electric shock nearly always lethal to all living beings. Recognizable by the bluish fog hovering above it in daylight. At nighttime, the "Electro" can be revealed using any type of detector or by throwing metal objects into the anomaly.</text>

  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_fuzz">
    <text>One of the Zone's examples of mutated vegetation. Reacts to rapidly approaching living beings by discharging a cloud of projectiles severely injuring uncovered or lightly protected skin upon contact. Does not react to slowly moving targets.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_gravi">
    <text>An anomaly of presumably gravitational nature. When triggered, the tremendous power of the Vortex drags everything within the radius of 10-15 meters towards center. Victims drawn into the core have no chance of survival: their bodies are quickly constricted into a tight lump, only to be blown up in a powerful discharge of energy a moment later. The anomaly remains stationary throughout its lifetime (a week on average). Easily recognizable in daylight by the air fluctuation above, dancing leaves, fragments of dismembered corpses lying around and a distinctive dark stain in the center. Highly dangerous at night since it can be revealed only by means of a detector or by throwing metal objects into it.</text>

  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_lift">

  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_meat">
    <text>This anomaly snatches its victims up in the air and spins them at a breakneck speed. The exact nature of the "Whirligig" remains unknown. The anomaly can be recognized by a light whirlwind of dust above and by body fragments scattered in the vicinity. Victims caught on its outer rim - far enough from the maximum effect zone at the center - can escape the "Whirligig" with relatively minor injuries.</text>

  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_radioactive">

  <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_zharka">
    <text>While inactive, this anomaly manifests itself as a barely visible cloud of hot air.

    <text>A strange, heavily contaminated area. Should you wander deeper into it, you will see a shallow lake, crammed shore-to-shore with abandoned equipment and other debris.

  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_locations_bar">
    <text>The Duty faction have set up camp here and they always welcome stalkers in need of rest. A desert oasis of sorts - a place that's mostly devoid of anomalies and mutants. Be sure to check out the Stalker bar that's under the old department store  - it's a meeting point for stalkers from all over the Zone. The bar is run by the local trader, so if you're interested in selling or buying wares apart from the local gossip - that's the place to go to. North of the bar is the military base, with the Garbage to the South.</text>

  <string id="enc_zone_locations_darkdolina">
    <text>Always gloomy, always misty and always rainy. Stalkers venturing into the Dark Valley are likely to find valuable artifacts, instant death, or both. A place frequented by some of the most experienced old-timers, though you may also stumble upon some common bandits. There's supposed to be an underground lab around there somewhere, so it might be worth to look for a hidden entrance along the way. No one has returned from there alive though and no one can tell for sure just what nasty surprises await you there.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_locations_escape">
    <text>Think of this place as the Zone's antechamber - it's a good place for rookies to get their head around. You'll find a trader in an basement in the middle of the village, next to the army outpost. Don't miss the chance to talk to him. You'd be advised to steer clear of the outpost itself, however. You don't want the soldiers to catch a sight of you - most of them shoot first and don't bother asking questions later. Yet, as always, there are some who can be bribed as long as the top brass is looking the other way. Attacking the soldiers is not recommended, unless if they pose a direct threat.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="enc_zone_locations_garbage">
    <text>A vast machinery graveyard. Right after the first accident whole heaps of radioactive waste were dumped there. This part of the Zone is mostly ruins of old buildings infested with mutants. Much like the outskirts of the Zone, the place swarms with rookie stalkers, with an occasional bandit loitering around, always on the lookout for freebies. Some artifacts to be found here, but most of them are just not worth the effort. You'll be better off elsewhere. Going North, you will get to the Stalker bar, East lays the entrance to the Dark Valley, with the road to the Agroprom Research Institute to the West.</text>

  <string id="enc_zone_locations_military-loc">
    <text>A deserted army base next to a dilapidated hamlet and a small marsh. A group of religious fanatics known as Sin have settled in the abandoned base. Sin believes in the divine essence of the Zone, believing that the Zone will lead to final redemption of mankind. According to Barkeep, about two weeks ago all the PDAs signals of the stalkers who are part of Sin went offline. Since then, nothing has been heard from them. All stalkers who approached their base disappeared. Most stalkers have speculated that either this group no longer exists, and something else has settled there and is destroying everyone who comes near, or everyone that's part of Sin have completely lost their minds and are attacking everyone.</text>

    <text>The legendary lake in the sector of the same name dried up a long ago, leaving a shallow swamp in its place. The place is morbid and sodden with death. Great dangers await any adventurous soul foolish enough to get near it. Anyone who dares to go too far goes insane. Zombie drones are rambling around the whole sector, waiting for new victims. The lake itself is poisonous - touching it without protection will lead to nasty acid burns. If you walk around the lake and past the zombies, you’ll end up at the scientists' camp, where the eggheads brought there by choppers are doing some research. You can have a chat with them; they buy artifacts and could even send you on a mission. In the center of the lake there are several large islands made of garbage and the skeletons of buildings. Several paths through shallow water lead to them.  The largest one has a descent into an unflooded basement.</text>

    <text>Reports are surfacing of strange occurrences within the inner ten-kilometer zone around Pripyat.\nThe city, long forgotten, has recently gained notoriety for sightings of unusual animals roaming its streets at night, with the first cases of missing persons emerging. Following the mysterious disappearance of a bus carrying foreign tourists, the zone was closed to visitors, but extensive investigations have yielded no answers; the bus appears to have simply vanished.\nRecently, locals brought a peculiar red-haired creature with a humanoid form, small stature, and large black eyes to a checkpoint. Officials confiscated the corpse, and, days later, newspapers in the capital dismissed the rumors, claiming it was merely an escaped monkey owned by a maintenance chief.</text>
