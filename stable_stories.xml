		<text>We head into the hangar - dust everywhere, cobwebs under the roof. The detectors are going haywire, spouting nonsense. They’re not just saying there’s no one around—they’re acting like we’re not even there. We move to take positions around the perimeter. Sanyok takes point, and we cover him. Then, bam! One of those big, rusty iron beams hanging from the ceiling breaks loose and crashes down. I don’t know how Sanyok dodged it, but it landed right where he’d been standing. He hit the ground, rolled away, and didn’t even bother getting up - just started firing from where he lay. The rest of us panicked, a bunch of idiots, shooting wildly at anything that moved - or didn’t move. Then Sanyok starts yelling about something in the corner. I look, but I can’t see any creature. The whole operation turned into a chaotic mess. We carefully picked our way through the ruins for about five minutes, trying to avoid the beams. But weird things kept happening—one guy fell into a pit on what looked like flat ground, another got hit across the back by a door that snapped off its hinges. At that point, it was clear: something was playing with us. We activated psionic-defense and started lobbing gas grenades into every corner, fingers on the triggers, waiting for whatever it was to show itself. But it turns out, the damn thing was above us the whole time, quietly lurking under the ceiling and messing with us. It wasn’t until the creature knocked loose a couple more girders—bringing half the roof down - that we finally figured it out. Four guys were crushed on the spot. Sanyok heard rustling overhead and reflexively fired a burst - probably the smartest reflex he’s ever had. The creature let out an ear-splitting shriek, and we all lit it up, every barrel we had blazing. It thrashed above us, screaming so loud my ears popped. When it finally hit the ground, we didn’t hold back. Some went at it with buttstocks; others stomped it into the dirt. Sanyok even pulled out a knife to make sure it felt every bit of it. The commander barely managed to drag us off, or we’d have kept going until there was nothing left but scraps to scrape off the floor with spoons.</text>

		<text>Have you heard of the Conductor? The very first stalker - the first to venture into the Zone, and he’s still alive. They say he can take you anywhere, but finding him is another matter. He doesn’t exactly put up posters with his location, and not everyone gets the privilege of his services. They say he charges a hefty price, but if you manage to find him and strike a deal, you can be sure he’ll get you where you need to go. That’s the kind of person I’d like to talk to. He’s probably seen what lies beyond the radar...</text>

		<text>There’s a big difference between making a fool of yourself and knowing how to make money in the Zone. What, you thought cash just falls into your lap? Not a chance. Out here, you’ll either get eaten by some mutant freak or shot by a fellow stalker. You’ve got to use your head. Bulls who charge in blindly don’t last long - this place doesn’t forgive stupidity. Anyway, here’s what happened. The three of us - me, Sinyak, and Tsepa (rest his soul) - were cutting through a back alley, taking a shortcut. That’s when we spotted a ‘deer’ - a rookie stalker walking by. The guy didn’t notice us, so we kept low. He was scrawny but hauling a bag, with a machine gun slung across his shoulder like he knew how to use it. Bruise nudges me and says, ‘Let’s feel out the brainiac, see what he’s carrying.’ But I told him, ‘Quiet, woodpecker! Let’s see where he’s stashing his loot.’ We followed him. The deer vanished into some ruins, so we waited. About twenty minutes later, he comes out, brushing himself off. Tsepa sneaks up behind him and, bam, puts half a round through his skull. They start looting the body - nice armor, and they’re hoping for a stash of cash. I stepped away to take a piss, confident they’d cut me my share. But the rookie wasn’t simple - he’d rigged his armor to explode if anyone tried to take it. I bolted as soon as I realized something was off. A month later, I came back. No sign of Tsepa, Bruise, or even the deer. Not a bone left. I figured out where the rookie had disappeared earlier and decided to check it out myself. Three rooms in, I found nothing - until I spotted a pile of beds in the corner. Weird, right? Why so many beds? So, I cleared the pile and found a hatch underneath. Opened it, shone my flashlight, and - yo! - I hit the jackpot. What happened next is my business, but I’ll tell you this: I didn’t end up broke. If I hadn’t kept my ears sharp, I’d have been a corpse by now - or still running barefoot through the Zone like some fools.</text>

		<text>They say there’s this group of folks - some call them shamans, others druids, depending on the mood. Supposedly, they don’t use any electronic gear at all - claim it’s about being closer to nature and all that. They believe the Zone doesn’t like electronics, that it reacts more strongly to electromagnetic radiation and even draws monsters toward you. To them, the Zone is a living organism, and you shouldn’t approach it with instruments - if you’re the right kind of person, you’ll manage just fine without all the gadgets. That said, they still carry machine guns - guess they’re not willing to rely on teeth and claws alone. Funny thing is, they don’t seem to die as often as others in the Zone. You don’t hear much about them kicking the bucket, so maybe they’re onto something. Word is they tend to enter the Zone from the Belarusian side. I’d love to see them up close someday - maybe even check how many artifacts they’ve got stuffed in their pockets.</text>

So the question arises - maybe there are no people working there? I've been talking to a guy... He didn't see the lab himself.....No, he didn't see it himself, but he caught some strange conversations on the "Yantar" on his scanner. They were talking about some kind of lab. And the other man swore that he had somehow stumbled upon a figure in a stalker-like suit, but more elaborate... And it was as if this translucent figure had told him to get the hell out of here. "Don't interfere, go away, we're working here." Well, the guy took a shit...understandably! How many of us have seen this before? On the other hand, it didn't seem to happen far off the radar... Well, you know. Right. So it's hardly true... But on the other hand... mutations, they're different, right? Maybe they're not people anymore, but some kind of energy entities? Ah? Come on, come on...

		<text>You know what I'll tell you? It's almost impossible to sleep in this part of the Zone... I'm lucky, I can't sleep as it is... but people have such nightmares that sometimes they don't wake up in the morning... from heartbreak, for example... Who moves horses, and who goes crazy... Recently, though, there's been a rumor that there is a cure. If you really need to sleep, it is desirable to find an old bucket... or at least a big pot... a pot of boiled water... The main thing is that it should be whole... You put your head in it - and sleep as if you were in God's pocket... Well, laugh, laugh. I'll see you in a couple of days when you're tired and fall off your feet. Smart guys... But tell me, why the hell did the soldiers start wearing tricky helmets lately? Yeah! I haven't heard a peep out of you in two years, but lately they've been coming around a lot! They got some new helmets. The guys found the body, they said. The mesh inside is made of a thin copper wire attached to the helmet. So you think, what's with the harness, what the hell is it for? There's a reason for that "g-g-g", I'm telling you. There is nothing to choose from the anomalies here - not those lands, in other areas and safer, and pieces of fattier still will be found... I think so, they are planning approaches. They're preparing a beachhead. They're trying to get to the Sarcophagus, mark my words. Soon it's gonna be so big, it's gonna be a big deal. Mark my word... The main thing is for you and me to get away from here at that time...</text>

		<text>Hey, you guys know anything about The Intercept? They say they're Special Forces, they say they're regular soldiers! But how they work, huh?! How they work! It's not like the assholes at the checkpoints! Not only do they go to the backwoods, but they stay in the Zone for months! I'm not bullshitting! They have bases, several of them at a time, a lot of caches, and to the perimeter of them on the camping choppers bring supplies to them. Their commander is some Gromov... I think his surname is fake, not real - they call him "Major" or "Thunder". You don't believe me?! So Pahomycz somehow caught the interception! I caught him, and God bless his legs, or they'd smack him for his life... Secrecy, that's how it is! Does everyone know Pahomich? Well, that's just it! It's not yucky, it's a serious team. I don't know what the hell they're up to, but they're working hard. I'd like a third - no, I'd like ten percent like that! - He would have already built a ten-story house in Sochi... They say they have such a thing... to spot monsters two hundred meters away. Any creature! Clearly, then you can walk around the Zone and spit... They also say there are some people... Not soldiers, but some of ours... In general, some people got into the center of the Zone. Not only did they sneak in, but they say they can tame creatures too! They don't go beyond the perimeter, to the Big Land at all - and nobody goes to them either... well, except, perhaps, for those who were born to get to the Sarcophagus... They have as many artifacts as you can wipe with! "Dutyovtsy"-they know about them well... they know, bastards, they fight - and keep silent! You ask one of these policemen: "Fairy tales," he says.

We were on our way back from Dark Valley, and I was a little behind my brothers. Evil took advantage of this and suddenly started playing with me. And...I questioned it. The true images were distorted; the Enemy whispered to me that the Monolith was using us as slaves. But then I realized: it's a challenge. I remembered the power and radiance of the Monolith, and then the will and confidence came back to me. Since then, I am no longer afraid of any challenge and know no doubts. Praise the Monolith!</text>

We fought fiercely with these animals. The brothers' merits were great: the Monolith soon called them to its fold. He had another challenge in store for me. My gun wasn't firing anymore. But then the Monolith said to me, "You are with me, and my power is with you. If you stand firm in your faith, you will crush my enemies and draw near to me!". Then I became a shadow. I ducked down and went around to their right. The stupid spies didn't notice anything. They thought they were done with us and laughed at the empty bodies of our brothers. But I could already see their backs. And then the power of the Monolith struck from my hands. So he killed them all. I am happy to serve you, Perfect.</text>

		<text>My partner and I have had our eye on this research institute for a long time. This place is deserted. No beasts in the neighborhood, no mutants. But whoever went there either came back scared out of their wits or never saw them again. We decided to do a little recon on our own. We left in the dark, and as soon as we reached the place, it was already getting light. We left the car in a clearing and walked through the woods to the edge of the forest. We stopped there, my partner stayed downstairs, and I went up to the tree with optics - to look around what was going on in the neighborhood. I see - buildings, and not so much abandoned, the windows are almost all intact, in the yards a little grass, not like in other places - waist-deep... It looked like they lived here, but it was completely silent and there was no movement. Suddenly the queues struck from a little to the right - someone from a machine gun was hitting short ones. I'm the optician over there. I see a strange man on the roof of one of the buildings, scurrying around like a hunted rat, shooting indiscriminately in all directions. I look at him and I can't understand: he was the only one there. And this is where... it began... I've seen it all in the palm of my hand. The machine gun flew out of his hands by itself... As if the iron had grown wings...! The man opened his mouth, yelled something, pulled out a knife and held it out in front of him. And then, holy crap! - I look and there's another one hanging in front of him. He's hanging in the air like that, with no one to hold him. What happened next is not a night to tell... It took about five minutes to cut that guy up. Little by little, bitches, fuck them by the foot - a cut here, a shot there... The poor guy was soon covered in blood... Then, as he began to falter in his legs, his knife was knocked out, too; then the man was lifted up into the air and twisted a couple of times... I've never seen such a thing in my life - it was like spinning a rag... I was wet in three seconds... Then... No, that's it, I won't. Anyway, as I caught my breath, I fumbled around the neighborhood with the scope for another five minutes. My hands were shaking, my optics were wet with sweat... At least one creature! In both normal and infrared, nothing. When I got off, my partner looked at me and didn't even bother to ask. And when we got back to the base, I got drunk for a week, I didn't dry out... Then, after I'd gotten a bit out of it, I asked around to see if anyone had heard of such a thing. Only the people started to look at me askance - is it possible that I've moved? That's the way it is...</text>

		<text>Anyway, my buddy told me this. The bosses got him up in the middle of the night and told him to run to the lab, the cargo had arrived. He's sleepy, he doesn't get it. What's the load? They said to him, "Have you been drinking too much government alcohol? There's a fresh corpse on the table, dinner's served! Anyway, he comes in, and to the table. And there's this... He, by the way, has seen dead people from the Zone in his life: torn, fried and fried, and mutants, and there were more than a dozen, and here, like in the stomach dinner began to walk. Anyway, from the first sight - without two minutes a man, only the head on normal does not look like a normal shit: a healthy such a pumpkin lumpy. And the body's a fucking concentration camp, skin and bones. But that's what he figured out later, but at first, he said, "I see a mess of some kind: everything's upside down, covered with orange-red stuff - blood, like...". Those Hondurans didn't spare any ammunition. Do-olg...search for anomalous objects, geez...no fucking search!... He said it was a mixture of a colander and a torn heating pad.......and they obviously took a good walk on it in their shitpants; not an object, but a piece of meat in black rags. Anyway, he spent the rest of the night and half the morning hunching over. It seems that this is the same creature that the locals know as an illusionist: black rags, visions of stalkers, a meter-wide head... The funny thing about his face, those who saw it thought it was a kind of a face. No, he has a natural personality, but it's small: his blinkers don't open and his nose is like a pin, though his mouth is huge, like a joint at the gate. He walks around and hangs his head on his chest - he can't keep it straight... And guess what these things eat for lunch. Fungi! Mushrooms! In short, everyone has seen - the Zone is full of mushrooms, so "old people" give a tooth that these things squeeze juice out of them. You know what he had stashed in a pouch on his side? Well? Oh, come on! Anyway, his brains were jerky in there. You know whose? Controllers!</text>

A rustle or a suspicious breeze... At least let a bunny run by... although bunnies here - God forbid... In a word, you have to be ready every second. To have magazines and grenades on hand and a machine gun on continuous. If you see something, plant half a horn at once; if there is something behind the bushes - also hit it, and then ask. This is a young fighter's course: they won't give you an outfit, they'll eat you up before you can fart! Yeah, about the controllers, that's a separate story. Let's say you shoot off on a rustle - and fall immediately, in the same second! On your back or whatever. The controller clings if he sees you - he needs to concentrate or something. While you're sunbathing in the shade, listen with both ears - whether there's a rustle, whether some crap is coming to you. You can quietly click the magazine, and grenades should also be prepared...

		<text>So... I remember someone asked me something yesterday and I forgot... Oh, I remember. There are, then, curious, why in the Zone only our eggheads are swarming, and foreigners and do not show their noses, although there are three thousand Nobel Prize materials... So, I'll answer point by point. First of all, why should we meddle here, when we can give ours a grant, with such conditions that it will bring you everything you need on a platter? Well, secondly, they've actually been here, a lot. It's the last two years foreigners are afraid to go into the Zone... there was one big bummer with them. Now they're just buying up materials and information. The pay is pretty good, so a lot of loners work for them, and looters too... Didn't you hear about this story? Oh, come on! The whole Zone was on its ear, and you fell out of the sky. All in all, the reservation was a big one. There are thirty scientists from half the world... all the luminaries, of course, back and forth... We prepared in earnest: we had money to eat, equipment - mountains. We took with us a platoon of military specialists for protection, three of our guides, loaded onto shielded BATERs and set off. What-what... They came back a week later... twelve men in a junked-up BATER. They came to the barb at the Rotten Forest, and there they were already waiting... Looters... Yeah... They don't give a shit where people got out of... They put almost everyone down. Only three made it outside the perimeter, two of us and one egghead. The man from impressions moved powerfully attic... Well, he quickly by the scruff of the neck - and treat. He's writing a book about the Zone now. Ours is still okay - experience helped. Although... they probably moved in their own way too: one went to the radar and disappeared, and the other went to the Big Land. And the Zone took the rest. Have you heard of the Town of Thirty-Two? That's where they got caught. At first everything seemed quiet... well, within limits... They were shooting and measuring, collecting samples, poking at anomalies with instruments... And then they started going crazy. Mass. The people began to slowly roof ride. I our - the one who retired - told me... Who started tearing his throat with his nails, who smashed his head against the wall, and who simply - the barrel in his mouth, and... And then there's the beast. Whoever was in their right mind barricaded themselves in the house. You're imagining it, aren't you? Outside, it's night and all the neighborhood critters, and inside, people are going crazy one by one. In short, in the morning, those who could still think, somehow got out. We drove straight back, without a road; we even caught a couple of anomalies... Got to the Rotten Forest... And of those who stayed there, no one was ever found. Guys just say there's a dramatic increase in controllers in those places. Yes... Since then, no one has been coming to the Town of Thirty-Two, and you can't lure a foreigner to the Zone with a stick...</text>

		<text>So that's what I was gonna say. I was there when they took that illusion, I was there! I just happened to be in those parts! My car, my "Niva", the right front wheel flew off: the bolts sheared off on a bump. And there's zero parts. I swore a lot, and then I thought, let me go to the factory and pick up the right ones. Well, it was a kilometer walk there, back and forth - half an hour! And I've been there before... Suddenly I see Dutyers! Not just a patrol, a half a hundred of them! Well, I think it's a fucking compote. Just like that, he fell into the bushes. "If they notice and start searching," I think, "then I'm fucked. I'm lying in a hole, and I'm trying not to breathe. And there's a shooting! I've only heard that kind of gunfire once in my life... when they took First Base, the old guys, remember? Anyway, I'm lying there, listening in both ears... It's going bang, and then it's going bang!.. After about five minutes it gets quiet and nobody seems to be coming to me. Well, I got the nerve to stand up a little and look through the binoculars. And these quickly pull out of the shop... crumpled like this, dragging a bunch of their stiffs and illusa on a tarpaulin... There's nothing left of illus... They've gone into the ravine. Then I hear the engines roar and the sound goes away. I waited some more, I don't see anyone. I'm going in. Well, clearly, you can't find anything after Duty! But interesting! That was something, I'll tell you! They almost dug through the walls. Beams across the floor, a piece of the roof collapsed. Knee-deep in shell casings - a natural shooting range. Blood, some kind of debris. I didn't find anything useful, though - just two horns full and a machine gun lying there, crushed by the beam, impossible to pull out... I forgot about the bolts, of course... I went back to the car, thought for five minutes, took a bolt off the other wheels... and drove slowly... And if I had gone out there earlier for half an hour... Yeah...</text>

		<text>Yeah, that's how I got all the way to the outskirts of Pripyat. So I thought the first thing I'd do was look around. I also found a higher point - there was a big boiler house with a pipe. Well, I went in carefully... I look, everything seems to be in order - dust is lying, there are no traces... I got into the furnace and crawled: there were steps inside the pipe. I'm fine, even the soot is no longer dirty - it's petrified... Carefully sticking out... It's beautiful! Half the city in the palm of your hand! Pulling out my binoculars and looking around... (slight pause) And then... I was about to slide down, and then a thought popped up: what's going on under my very nose, and I didn't look! I bend a little over the edge, look at one side, then the other... Oh-oh! That would be a hit! There's a dwarf walking around the courtyard! I'm almost going down! It's okay that he can't see me yet. But I can't blow his turret off: the "kalash" hangs on my back, and the pipe is narrow, so I can't turn around. From the "Makarov" that is under my arm - a shitty business, there are fifty meters, and the difference in height... in short, if I don't hit at once - and I won't - then it's definitely dead. I'm sitting here thinking. I'm just checking to see what he's doing. And he's doing something he doesn't understand. At first, he was cheerfully, with fire, digging through a pile of junk - only pieces were flying left and right. And then all of a sudden he just stood there, frozen. I think I was listening. And then it got really messy. The trash in that pile started moving on its own. The dwarf quickly jumped back, stood like a pillar, put his hands to his head, turned his palms somehow cunningly... and into him ka-ak flying! All sides! Iron, bricks, roofing felt, branches... He was covered headfirst like that. Well, I guess that's it. Kitty's dead, he won't piss again... No way! For two seconds this junk was lying there, and then just like that, it splashed in all directions! There were some pipe scraps, so they stuck right into the concrete fence. Carla stood there for another half a minute, thought about something, and then turned around and went into the building. I took another minute to catch my breath. "Well," I think, "it's time to get out of here. And then all of a sudden there was a whiff of smoke. And then it started to get hot. Fuck you! Someone started a fire from downstairs! After a minute, I couldn't breathe. I shoveled myself out to the edge of the chimney - there's no platform there, I'm sitting with my legs hanging down... But the smoke still eats my eyes, there's not enough air... in short, we have to leave immediately! Thank God, I always carried forty meters of cord with me just in case of fire... I was sure that fire... Anyway, I folded it in half - it wasn't very thick - I fixed it on the pipe, torn my handkerchief in half, wrapped it around my shoelaces, and climbed up, praying to all gods... I had only one thought in my head: just don't fall off! No insurance, nothing, the cord cuts the palms of the hands... And, of course, by the law of meanness, five meters to the ground it was not enough. I had to jump. What can I do? Oh, I'm so screwed! I was lucky I didn't break anything... But I got skinned and pulled my right leg - big time! Then I thought I'd torn a ligament. And then yanked from there so that the gold medal in the race, probably would have won...</text>

		<text>I couldn't believe my eyes at the time. I mean, there are some pretty girls out there, right? But this one was... she's... Perfect. Yeah. Here. Perfection. It felt like the world around her was black and white and blurry, she was alone in color and sharpness. How she moved! I've never seen that before either. I got a lump in my throat. She doesn't need that science! What's she gonna do here in the Zone? Yeah, in the Zone. It was towards evening. There's a separate nine-story building by the bus power plant. First something flashed in the window on the first floor. I quickly took off the safety of my AK, and then I saw him coming out of the entrance... I wanted to wipe my eyes - what can you expect from the Zone? And she fits. And I'm standing there like a fool, staring... I keep my automatic rifle ready, though - I'm used to it... Then she noticed me... She smiled... She said hello... And I'm listening and not hearing, looking at her. She was wearing a blue outfit, brightly colored... but not a halachon, but almost tight... Her figure is something fantastic! It was only then that I realized that I wasn't listening to what she was saying - I was standing there smiling ear to ear... She turned out to be from the research group. Asked if there was any way I could help her. Hey! I'd go into an anomaly for her. Said she was dealing with these, what's-her-name... endemics of the Zone. You know, plants that are only found here. Said she ran away from the guards because there's no leeway with them, and came here alone. I don't know. I believed it. I agreed to help her by bringing her something. Two days later, he came as agreed. Nearly broke five times while reassembling it. I'm walking, and I have only one thought in my head: I'm going to see her again! And nothing. I didn't even see the house where I met her. Here we go... But what a woman she was! I mean, she was glowing from the inside out.</text>
