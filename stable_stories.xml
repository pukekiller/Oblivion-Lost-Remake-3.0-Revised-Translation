		<text>We head into the hangar - dust everywhere, cobwebs under the roof. The detectors are going haywire, spouting nonsense. They’re not just saying there’s no one around—they’re acting like we’re not even there. We move to take positions around the perimeter. Sanyok takes point, and we cover him. Then, bam! One of those big, rusty iron beams hanging from the ceiling breaks loose and crashes down. I don’t know how Sanyok dodged it, but it landed right where he’d been standing. He hit the ground, rolled away, and didn’t even bother getting up - just started firing from where he lay. The rest of us panicked, a bunch of idiots, shooting wildly at anything that moved - or didn’t move. Then Sanyok starts yelling about something in the corner. I look, but I can’t see any creature. The whole operation turned into a chaotic mess. We carefully picked our way through the ruins for about five minutes, trying to avoid the beams. But weird things kept happening—one guy fell into a pit on what looked like flat ground, another got hit across the back by a door that snapped off its hinges. At that point, it was clear: something was playing with us. We activated psionic-defense and started lobbing gas grenades into every corner, fingers on the triggers, waiting for whatever it was to show itself. But it turns out, the damn thing was above us the whole time, quietly lurking under the ceiling and messing with us. It wasn’t until the creature knocked loose a couple more girders—bringing half the roof down - that we finally figured it out. Four guys were crushed on the spot. Sanyok heard rustling overhead and reflexively fired a burst - probably the smartest reflex he’s ever had. The creature let out an ear-splitting shriek, and we all lit it up, every barrel we had blazing. It thrashed above us, screaming so loud my ears popped. When it finally hit the ground, we didn’t hold back. Some went at it with buttstocks; others stomped it into the dirt. Sanyok even pulled out a knife to make sure it felt every bit of it. The commander barely managed to drag us off, or we’d have kept going until there was nothing left but scraps to scrape off the floor with spoons.</text>

		<text>Have you heard of the Conductor? The very first stalker - the first to venture into the Zone, and he’s still alive. They say he can take you anywhere, but finding him is another matter. He doesn’t exactly put up posters with his location, and not everyone gets the privilege of his services. They say he charges a hefty price, but if you manage to find him and strike a deal, you can be sure he’ll get you where you need to go. That’s the kind of person I’d like to talk to.

		<text>There’s a big difference between making a fool of yourself and knowing how to make money in the Zone. What, you thought cash just falls into your lap? Not a chance. Out here, you’ll either get eaten by some mutant freak or shot by a fellow stalker. You’ve got to use your head. Bulls who charge in blindly don’t last long - this place doesn’t forgive stupidity. Anyway, here’s what happened. The three of us - me, Sinyak, and Tsepa (rest his soul) - were cutting through a back alley, taking a shortcut. That’s when we spotted a ‘deer’ - a rookie stalker walking by. The guy didn’t notice us, so we kept low. He was scrawny but hauling a bag, with a machine gun slung across his shoulder like he knew how to use it. Bruise nudges me and says, ‘Let’s feel out the brainiac, see what he’s carrying.’ But I told him, ‘Quiet, woodpecker! Let’s see where he’s stashing his loot.’ We followed him. The deer vanished into some ruins, so we waited. About twenty minutes later, he comes out, brushing himself off. Tsepa sneaks up behind him and, bam, puts half a round through his skull. They start looting the body - nice armor, and they’re hoping for a stash of cash. I stepped away to take a piss, confident they’d cut me my share. But the rookie wasn’t simple - he’d rigged his armor to explode if anyone tried to take it. I bolted as soon as I realized something was off. A month later, I came back. No sign of Tsepa, Bruise, or even the deer. Not a bone left. I figured out where the rookie had disappeared earlier and decided to check it out myself. Three rooms in, I found nothing - until I spotted a pile of beds in the corner. Weird, right? Why so many beds? So, I cleared the pile and found a hatch underneath. Opened it, shone my flashlight, and - yo! - I hit the jackpot. What happened next is my business, but I’ll tell you this: I didn’t end up broke. If I hadn’t kept my ears sharp, I’d have been a corpse by now - or still running barefoot through the Zone like some fools.</text>

		<text>They say there’s this group of folks - some call them shamans, others druids, depending on the mood. Supposedly, they don’t use any electronic gear at all - claim it’s about being closer to nature and all that. They believe the Zone doesn’t like electronics, that it reacts more strongly to electromagnetic radiation and even draws monsters toward you. To them, the Zone is a living organism, and you shouldn’t approach it with instruments - if you’re the right kind of person, you’ll manage just fine without all the gadgets. That said, they still carry machine guns - guess they’re not willing to rely on teeth and claws alone. Funny thing is, they don’t seem to die as often as others in the Zone. You don’t hear much about them kicking the bucket, so maybe they’re onto something. Word is they tend to enter the Zone from the Belarusian side. I’d love to see them up close someday - maybe even check how many artifacts they’ve got stuffed in their pockets.</text>

		<text>Anyone heard of any labs still running deep in the Zone? I mean, actually working labs. Yeah, yeah, I know - it sounds impossible. No supplies, no power, no way anyone could survive out there. So here’s the question: maybe there aren’t people working there at all? I talked to a guy - he didn’t see the lab himself, but he picked up some strange chatter on his scanner near Yantar. They were talking about some kind of lab. Another guy swore he stumbled across a figure in what looked like a stalker suit, but more advanced, almost otherworldly. He claimed the figure, translucent and eerie, told him straight up: ‘Get out of here. Don’t interfere - we’re working.’ Naturally, the guy freaked out - who wouldn’t? We’ve all heard weird stories before, and this supposedly happened not far from the radar, so maybe it’s just another tall tale. But then again, mutations come in all shapes, right? Maybe it’s not people anymore, but some kind of energy entities doing the work. Who knows? Go ahead, laugh - but one day, you might see it for yourself.</text>

		<text>You know what? It’s nearly impossible to get any sleep in this part of the Zone. Lucky for me, I barely sleep as it is, but the nightmares people have out here? They’re so bad some don’t even wake up in the morning - heart failure, they say. Some lose their minds entirely. There’s been talk recently about a so-called cure, though. If you’re desperate for sleep, the trick is to find an old bucket - or better yet, a big pot. It has to be whole, no cracks. Fill it with boiling water, and somehow, if you put your head inside, you’ll sleep like a baby. Go ahead and laugh, but when you’re dead on your feet in a couple of days, you’ll be the first one hunting down a bucket. Now, here’s something else to think about. You notice how the soldiers have been coming around more lately? Haven’t seen much of them for years, and now they’re back, sporting these fancy helmets. Word is, the guys found one on a body. The inside’s lined with a mesh of thin copper wire, rigged into the helmet somehow. Makes you wonder what it’s for, right? I’m telling you, there’s something to it. These anomalies around here aren’t worth much - safer areas have better finds. So why the sudden interest? I think they’re preparing for something big, planning their way to the Sarcophagus. Mark my words, when it happens, it’s gonna be chaos. You and me? We better make sure we’re long gone by then.</text>

		<text>Hey, have you heard about the Interceptors? Some say they’re Special Forces, others claim they’re just regular soldiers - but the way they operate? Unbelievable. They’re nothing like those clowns working at the checkpoints! These guys head deep into the Zone and stay there for months. No joke - they’ve got bases, tons of stashes, and supply helicopters bringing them gear right to the perimeter. Their commander, some guy called Gromov - probably a fake name - they call him ‘Major’ or ‘Thunder.’ Don’t believe me? Ask Pahomych - he once stumbled onto one of their operations. Barely got out alive, because they don’t mess around with secrecy. You know Pahomych, right? Exactly. These guys are serious, not amateurs. Whatever they’re up to, it’s big. If I had even ten percent of their budget, I’d have a mansion in Sochi by now. They’ve got tech that can spot monsters from two hundred meters - any creature! With gear like that, you’d stroll through the Zone without a care. And get this - there’s talk of others, not soldiers, but people like us who’ve made it to the Zone’s center. Rumor has it they can even tame creatures. They never leave the Zone, and no one goes near them - except maybe the lunatics trying to reach the Sarcophagus. They’re swimming in artifacts, enough to wipe the floor with! Duty knows all about them too, those bastards - they fight with them but keep their mouths shut. Ask them, and they’ll brush it off as fairy tales. Bunch of liars, right?</text>

It whispered lies, distorting true visions and claiming the Monolith was using us as slaves. For a moment, I wavered. But then I understood - it was a trial. I recalled the Monolith’s power and radiance, and with that, my will and confidence returned. Since that moment, I fear no challenge and harbor no doubt. Praise the Monolith</text>

My weapon failed - it would no longer fire. In that moment, the Monolith spoke to me: 'You are with me, and my power is with you. Stand firm in your faith, and you will crush my enemies and draw closer to me! I became as a shadow, crouching low and circling to their right. The foolish spies, thinking they had finished us, mocked the fallen bodies of my brothers. But they didn’t notice me. I was already behind them, watching their backs. Then the power of the Monolith surged through me, and with my hands, I struck them down. He guided me to destroy them all. I am honored to serve you, Perfect One.</text>

		<text>My partner and I had been eyeing this research institute for a while. The place seemed deserted - no beasts, no mutants - but everyone who went there either came back terrified or vanished altogether. We decided to scout it out ourselves. We left in the dark, and by dawn, we reached the area. Leaving the car in a clearing, we hiked through the woods to the edge of the forest. My partner stayed below while I climbed a tree with optics to survey the surroundings. The buildings looked oddly intact - windows unbroken, grass barely growing in the yards, as if the place was still inhabited. But it was silent - no movement, nothing. Suddenly, I heard bursts of gunfire to the right. Through the scope, I spotted a man on the roof of one building, darting around like a cornered animal, firing wildly in all directions. He seemed to be alone, but then it began. His machine gun flew out of his hands as if it had grown wings. He screamed, drew a knife, and held it out, but then I saw another figure - hanging in midair, with no one holding him. For five horrifying minutes, I watched as the invisible force tore the man apart—slowly, methodically. His knife was knocked away, his body lifted and twisted like a rag doll, blood pooling beneath him. I was drenched in sweat, trembling, but when I scanned the area afterward - normal and infrared, I saw nothing. Back at the base, my partner didn’t even ask what happened, and I drank myself senseless for a week. When I finally sobered up and asked around, people started looking at me like I’d lost my mind. Maybe I have.</text>

		<text>My buddy told me this story. In the middle of the night, his bosses woke him up and told him to head to the lab - some cargo had arrived. Half-asleep, he didn’t understand what was going on, so he asked, ‘What kind of cargo?’ They snapped back, ‘Been drinking too much government alcohol? There’s a fresh corpse on the table, dinner’s served!’ So he heads to the lab and sees it. Now, he’s seen plenty of dead bodies from the Zone before - ripped apart, burned, mutants, you name it - but this one made his stomach churn. At first glance, it looked almost human, but not quite. The head was massive, lumpy, and completely unnatural, while the body was skeletal, like skin stretched over bones. The first thing he noticed, though, was the mess: everything covered in orange-red stuff—blood, or something like it. Whoever brought it in didn’t hold back. The thing looked like it had been riddled with bullets, shredded to pieces, wrapped in black rags, and left for dead. My buddy spent the rest of the night and half the morning examining it. Turns out, this was the creature locals call an 'illusionist' - black rags, stalker-like visions, and that enormous head. But here’s the strangest part: its ‘face,’ if you can call it that, wasn’t what people think. It had tiny, nearly invisible eyes, a pin-sized nose, and a massive mouth like a gate hinge. It couldn’t even hold its head up straight, letting it droop onto its chest. And guess what these things eat? Mushrooms! Everyone knows the Zone is full of fungi, and the old-timers swear these creatures survive by squeezing the juice out of them. But the real kicker? When my buddy checked the pouch it had on its side, he found dried brains. Not just any brains - Controller brains!</text>

		<text>We had a fool join us once - lazy as they come. Whenever we stopped for a quick rest, he’d instantly flop down, and when it was time to move, he’d always be the last to get up. One day, he lagged behind, and that was it - a Controller got him, right to his brains. Let this be a lesson: in the Zone, you have to be ready every second. Hear a rustle or feel a suspicious breeze? Stay sharp. Even if it’s just a rabbit - though rabbits here are no joke - you’d better have your mags loaded, grenades ready, and your gun set to full auto. If you see something, don’t hesitate - fire half a mag, ask questions later. That’s the rookie survival course: no caution, no second chances - they’ll eat you alive. Controllers, though, are a special case. If you shoot at a sound and a Controller’s nearby, hit the ground immediately - flat on your back, anywhere out of sight. They need to focus to latch onto you, so while you’re lying low, listen closely for any movement. Quietly reload, prep your grenades, and if it’s clear, count to three and get the hell out. Got that? Good. The only way to survive here is to stay alert every single second. No exceptions.</text>

		<text>I’ve been wondering - no, speculating - what if all of this is some kind of experiment on people? Maybe it’s aliens behind it. Why not? It’s as good a theory as any. If this place is a testing ground, then what are they testing exactly? Are they seeing which artifacts we’re drawn to the most? Or are these things bombs, spread across the globe, cooked up in secret labs and sold to the rich under the table? Imagine that - spending a fortune on some ‘exclusive’ artifact, flaunting it like it’s the best, only for it to blow up in their faces. Honestly, I’d find that hilarious. But really, who knows what’s going on here? Maybe the ones who’ve made it to the radar could tell us - if they weren’t just drooling and mumbling nonsense afterward. Maybe that’s the point; maybe we’re not meant to understand. And that’s when these kinds of thoughts creep in… not exactly fun, is it?</text>

	<string id="stalker_story_6">
		<text>So, I remember someone asking me yesterday why only our scientists are swarming the Zone while foreigners keep their distance, even though there’s enough material here to win a dozen Nobel Prizes. Let me break it down for you. First, why risk their necks when they can just throw grants at our researchers to deliver everything they need on a silver platter? And second, they have been here - plenty. It’s only in the past couple of years that foreigners have stopped venturing into the Zone, ever since one big fiasco scared them off. Now they just buy materials and intel, paying pretty well, which is why so many loners and scavengers work for them. Haven’t heard the story? Come on, it was all anyone talked about. So, this expedition gets organized—a massive one. Thirty scientists from all over the world, with piles of cash, top-notch gear, a platoon of military specialists for protection, and three of our best guides. They loaded up into shielded BAT-ER vehicles and set off. A week later, they came back... or rather, twelve of them did, crammed into a wrecked BAT-ER. They barely made it to the Red Forest checkpoint, where looters were waiting. The looters wiped out almost everyone - only three survived: two of ours and one foreign scientist. The egghead was so messed up he completely lost it; they hauled him off to treatment, and now he’s writing a book about the Zone. Of our two guys, one disappeared near the radar, and the other went back to the Big Land. The rest? The Zone took them. They got caught in the Town of Thirty-Two. At first, everything seemed normal - they were taking samples, poking anomalies, shooting, measuring, you know the drill. But then people started going insane - slowly, one by one. Some tore at their throats with their nails, some bashed their heads against the walls, and others just put a barrel in their mouths and pulled the trigger. And then the creatures came. Those still sane barricaded themselves in a house, but outside, it was night, crawling with critters, while inside, people kept losing their minds. By morning, a handful managed to escape, driving straight back through anomalies, barely making it to the Red Forest. No one who stayed behind was ever found, but since then, controllers have swarmed that area. That’s why no one dares go to the Town of Thirty-Two anymore. And as for foreigners? You couldn’t drag one back into the Zone with a stick.</text>

		<text>So, here’s what I was going to say - I was there when they took down that illusion, I swear! Just happened to be in the area. My car, my old Niva, had the right front wheel fly off - the bolts sheared off on a bump. No spare parts, nothing. I cursed a lot, then figured I’d walk to the factory nearby and scavenge what I needed. It was only a kilometer, half an hour round trip. I’d been there before, no big deal. Suddenly, I see Duty members - not a patrol, but at least fifty of them. My first thought? ‘This is bad.’ So, I dove into the bushes, thinking, ‘If they spot me and start searching, I’m done for.’ I lay there, barely breathing, and then it starts - shooting like I’ve never heard before. The only thing I can compare it to is when they took First Base, you know what I mean. I’m lying there, listening as it goes bang, bang, nonstop for five minutes. Then silence. Nobody comes near me, so I get the nerve to peek with my binoculars. I see them - dragging their dead and something that must’ve been the illusion, crumpled on a tarpaulin. Whatever it was, there was nothing left of it. They disappeared into the ravine, and I hear engines roar as they take off. I waited a while longer, then crept over to see what was left. Not much - Duty doesn’t leave scraps. But it was something else, I’ll tell you. They’d practically dug through the walls. Beams collapsed, blood everywhere, shell casings knee-deep - like a warzone. Found nothing useful except two full mags and a crushed machine gun pinned under a beam I couldn’t move. I forgot all about the bolts and went back to the car. After thinking for five minutes, I just pulled a bolt off the other wheels and drove off slowly. And you know what? If I’d gone out there just half an hour earlier… yeah…</text>

		<text>This is how I ended up on the outskirts of Pripyat.. first thing I thought to do was get a good look around, so I found a high spot - a big boiler house with a tall pipe. I went in carefully, checked the place - dust everywhere, no signs of movement. Inside the furnace, I found steps leading up the pipe. The soot had hardened, so it wasn’t even dirty anymore. I climbed up and stuck my head out the top - beautiful! Half the city spread out in the palm of my hand. Pulled out my binoculars and started scanning the area. Just as I was about to climb down, a thought hit me: I hadn’t checked right below me. Leaning over the edge, I looked around and, oh boy, what a sight - a dwarf wandering around the courtyard! I froze. He couldn’t see me yet, but there was no way I could take him out. My AK was slung on my back, and the pipe was too narrow to turn around. The Makarov under my arm? Useless - fifty meters and height difference, no way I’d land the first shot, and if I missed, I’d be toast. So, I sat tight and watched. At first, the dwarf was tearing through a pile of junk, flinging pieces left and right like he was on fire. Then he just froze, like he was listening to something. That’s when it got weird. The pile of junk started moving on its own. The dwarf jumped back, stood there stiff, and raised his hands to his head, twisting his palms in some strange way. Suddenly, everything - iron, bricks, branches - flew straight at him from all directions, covering him completely. I thought, ‘That’s it, he’s done for.’ But no. Two seconds later, the pile exploded outward with such force that metal scraps embedded themselves into the concrete fence. The dwarf stood there a moment longer, then calmly walked into the building. I sat there catching my breath, thinking it was time to leave, when I smelled smoke. Then it got hot - someone had started a fire below. Within minutes, I couldn’t breathe, and the smoke was eating at my eyes. I shuffled to the edge of the chimney, dangling my legs over, but the air was no better. I had to get out immediately. Luckily, I always carried forty meters of cord for emergencies. I doubled it up, tied it to the pipe, ripped my handkerchief in half to wrap around my shoelaces, and started climbing down, praying the whole way. No safety gear, the cord cutting into my palms - and, of course, it was five meters short of the ground. I had no choice but to jump. I hit the ground hard, skinning myself and pulling my right leg. At first, I thought I tore a ligament. Limping like hell, I got out of there so fast I probably could’ve won a gold medal in a race!</text>

It felt like the entire world around her was black-and-white and blurry, and she alone was in color - sharp, vibrant. The way she moved, too - I’d never seen anything like it. It left a lump in my throat. She didn’t belong here. What would someone like her be doing in the Zone? It was nearing evening, near the bus power plant, where there’s a lone nine-story building. I saw something flash in a window on the first floor. Instinctively, I took the safety off my AK, and then she appeared - stepping out of the entrance. I had to rub my eyes - this is the Zone, after all. But there she was, walking toward me. I stood there like a fool, staring, my rifle still ready out of habit. Then she noticed me. She smiled and said hello, but I was too dumbstruck to really hear her, just standing there grinning like an idiot. She wore a bright blue outfit - tight-fitting, not like the usual hazmat suits or gear you’d see around here. Her figure? Unbelievable. That’s when I realized I hadn’t heard a word she’d said. Turns out, she was part of a research group, asking if I could help her. Help her? I’d have walked into an anomaly for her! She said she was studying Zone endemics - plants unique to this place - and had slipped away from her guards because they were too restrictive. I believed her. Agreed to bring her something she needed. Two days later, I went back, nearly breaking my neck five times getting her supplies, thinking only of seeing her again. But when I got there - nothing. No sign of her. Not even the building where I’d met her seemed to exist. Just gone. But God, what a woman she was - she glowed, like she was lit from within.</text>
